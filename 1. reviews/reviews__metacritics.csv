Citizen Kane,"it's generally a good movie and pretty watchable, but in no way is it the greatest movie of all-time. in truth, probably not even in the top 1000.","it's a boring movie and i am surprised that this is one of the top movies of all time. however, the cinematic techniques were pretty good for the time the movie was made.","for the time, this movie may have been gold. that is a fact that no one can dispute. however, it absolutely does not hold up today. citizen kane is a dull, boring and unsatisfying film that while yes, for the time its technical achievements were a marvel to see, did not live up to the hype for me. to me, this is not one of the top 100 films of all time anymore.","my personal favorite movie of all time, orson welles's citizen kane is a masterpiece of cinema. the most acclaimed element of the film the camera work, which is still to this day impressive. but it isn't just there to be flashy, it helps to tell the story. the shot of kane walking through the mirrors might be the most depressing shot in history. the cinematography isn't the only innovative part of this film. the movie opens with the protagonist dying, and then his life is told in flashbacks, a revolutionary idea for 1941. the narrative structure and the cinematography are usually what is talked about in reviews of citizen kane (and they are amazing), but other aspects of the film are just as good. the performances from the mercury actors are all phenomenal, keep in mind they all had to age fifty years for their roles. the script (the only thing that won an oscar) is also fantastic, the bernstein monologue being one of the stand out moments. bernard herman's score is also great, i love the music that plays when reading thacher's account of kane's childhood and at the end of the film (i  won't spoil what it is showing in case you haven't seen it). citizen kane is as close to perfect as a film can get, if you haven't seen it watch it now!","it's absolutely one of those movies who you must watch before you die. really great story even if it's about fictional character, he is really great designed.","yang kasih rate 0-3 berarti sengaja menjatuhkan karya orang lain, lu pikir bikin film itu mudah ? lu pikir penilaian sebuah film bagus atau tidak cuma dinilai dari plot nya / ceritanya saja misalnya ? kalo mau kontribusi kasih rate yang objektif lah, pertimbangkan aspek2 lain dalam film tersebut (unsur2 intrinsik film).  saya pribadi sangat tidak suka dengan orang2 yang tidak menghargai karya orang lain, dengan melakukan penilaian hanya dari aspek2 tertentu, tidak menilainya secara keseluruhan (semua aspek yg ada dinilai) serta memberikan penilaian secara obyektif, bukannya berdasarkan emosi/perasaan sendiri semata, alias subyektif.","very boring........................if i watch it again bc someone tells me its great, i'll lower this score.","it's a really nice movie, but ""the best movie ever made""? no. maybe the most important or influential, but not the best ever made, or at least, not anymore. though i still consider orson welles to be brillant.","my favorite. it is so good, it is so revolutionary. just chills. recommend to everyone. however younger movie fans may not like it","this movie is incredibly boring, and while it did bring to the table many modern filming techniques it's nothing to go on about.","would i say it's the greatest film of all time? no. would i say it's even among a favourite of mine? not really. the performances were good and i love how much depth kane has as a character but the movie dragged in some parts and the pacing wasn't consistent, at least to me. it's alright but i really don't get all the hype behind it.","decent performance from welles, but the plot meanders so much by the end you'll be wondering what the point was. nice cinematography.","citizen kane is, simpliciter, the finest film ever made. apparently. and we know this because, historically, it has garnered universal acclaim. if this tells us anything, it should tell us that lead poisoning has had a much more baleful influence upon our civilization than previously assumed. thankfully, with the benefit of hindsight and modern medical advances in the remediation of heavy metal toxicity, we are slowly and steadily coming to find that the finest film ever made is actually paul verhoeven's masterpiece, starship troopers.","i remember watching this with my mother and she said ""why the **** are the graphics so bad"" i said ""ya, is this graphically flawed movie the best of all time"" i mean, i aint no hippy joe, but i can see the difference between a waffle and a pancake. and this is no pancake, this is the atrocity of why human being experience envy, lust and desperation. can't believe this fake movie is the best. go watch fate of the furiousvin diesel not approved.","reluctant to watch an film made before your parents were born?  a film that is black and white - and a name like citizen kane.  i was.  then a cinefriend of mine made me watch it - and i loved it!  the story is captivating, the filmmaking and structure still edgy and modern - and then when you begin to study it - as i did in film school - it's one of the films you see in almost every class for it's powerful impact in every department of the filmmaking process.  watch this film - and watch it big if you can - orson welles genius still stands strong.","while the third act isn't the perfectly built and entertaining as the rest of the movie, it still is one of the greatest pictures ever made, because of its innovative editing, great performances and deep character study that shows the darkest side of the american dream.","citizen kane is a remarkable work of cinema, often credited as the greatest motion picture ever created. and there is great reason for it. at its core it follows the story of charles foster kane, a newspaper publisher soon to be politician. the film is mostly told through flashbacks allowing the audience to see kane's life journey and how he develops into who he is by the end of the film. the great story is backed up by amazing performances and direction that only add to the overall effect. when the film first released it also set many new standards for cinema. the cinematography and lighting specifically are done so well in each scene. the way each shot is composed and lit conveys certain emotions and messages unlike any movie before its time. the use of music and sound is also very important and is executed very effectively. as a whole, citizen kane is a fantastically crafted film that all should see.","had not seen in 20 years, i felt younger just watching it.  photography is extremely solid, it felt a little like psycho in opening shot.  tricks were amazing, the snowball zoomout was genius, camera work all around is stellar. perfect use of film reels for plot, like putting the plot i  the pillow shots.  what a fantastic study in narcissism, he lived his whole life with no empathy, he refused to consider the perspectives of others.  pretty good, 'you don't love me, you just want me to love you.' the dialog is amazing.  'i see, it's you that this is being done to, not me at all.' his wife had the best lines.  also, the thesis is about how most of our wounds come from early childhood, the worst may come trying to prevent some other thing that was the worst, his mom sent him away to protect him from his dad, but regardless of that and wealth, kane became injured all the same, like it was in his genes.  he was made narcissistic as a child, before he was sent away, the mom was clearly too beat down to love him and his dad was too angry to love him really.  it is very much a freudian movie, interesting to consider if it was a jungian movie it would be called 'citizen neo'","wonderful, marvelous, glorious, fabulous... this is citizen kane. every time that i see is the same satisfaction and excitation with the history of unforgettable charles foster kane. eternal aplauses to orson welles for this work. greetings from natal, brazil!","intelligent, ground-breaking, a great filmic language accomplishment, a timeless case study.","wow, what a film. after rewatching citizen kane plenty of times, i sit hear writing my review to tell you that your no film buff if you say this movie sucks. orson well's legendary film has everything: a well written story, excellent acting, and of course incredable screenwriting. when observing this film, you can see that this film has inspired countless films, and is the ""godfather"" of films. don't let yourself tell you that just because this is a old movie, and is black and white, it is not a great movie. it is, and will stay with you forever.","a unique way to present a quasi-biographical film.  cotten is amazing portraying the casual mannered leland, with a mysterious dark apathy.  welles' intensity as the protagonist, kane, is compelling.  the underpinning rosebud mystery serves as an intriguing backbone to the plot.","when a reporter is assigned to decipher newspaper magnate charles foster kane's (orson welles) dying words, his investigation gradually reveals the fascinating portrait of a complex man who rose from obscurity to staggering heights. though kane's friend and colleague jedediah leland (joseph cotten), and his mistress, susan alexander (dorothy comingore), shed fragments of light on kane's life, the reporter fears he may never penetrate the mystery of the elusive man's final word, ""rosebud."" orson welles's epic tale of a publishing tycoon's rise and fall is entertaining, poignant, and inventive in its storytelling, earning its reputation as a landmark achievement in film. final grade is an a+.","don't tell me you're sorry..citizen kanedepicting a marriage within few minutes or even a career of an entertainer represents a keen and devoting man behind the camera as it probably is the first time the cinema must have encountered a 'biography' genre film with such powerful sequence and fast paced acts. citizen kane is considered to be one of the few masterpieces ever to be set in cinema history but for me it doesn't quite works for i fail to connect it on the first instinct and the soul of it as its genre is something that i can't seem to understand but having said that i can definitely observe and appreciate the craft ensemble by the actors and projecting it majestically along with the writers and makers who are not only completely attentive to each and every frame of it but speaks the cinematic language through their work. and as its genre suggests and asks for, orson hasn't let it down through out the course of it pushing citizen kane onto the major league with the help of a gripping screenplay, stellar performances and some nail biting sequences that genuinely oozes brutality and humanity in the characters.","inspiring narrative, use of deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts. the breakfast montage is extremely lovely, which was cited in kendrick lamar's music video ""love.""","i watched this movie to see if it was as great as people say it is and i must say, it is. there is constantly very good acting, unique storytelling, and incredible directing, which makes a heartbreaking drama about a newspaper tycoon. this is the greatest film i have ever seen.","this film focuses on the figure of mr. kane, an important news baron that just passed away, leaving the journalists grappling with its mysterious and enigmatic last words. directed and written by orson welles, who also gives life to the lead role, this film also has the participation of other players and is considered by many the best film ever made.first of all, its necessary to clarify one thing: despite the opinions of many people consider this movie the best ever, these considerations are always subjective and likely to be discussed. each person has the right to think of another way, like it or not, period. now let's get down to business.when i saw this movie for the first time i was not able to understand or to see why it was so acclaimed by critics. currently i'm most able to understand the reasons. the actors glittered in their roles, particularly welles, who would become one of the film's biggest names in his time. the script is simple, but it tells a good story, which addresses such important issues as the simplicity and true happiness. its a film made with love by those involved, where every detail has been thought and rethought. the use of non-linear narrative, through the use of constant flashbacks, allows the public to see the life of the deceased millionaire, a missing character, but always present. the scenarios are excellent and even the camera angles were thought innovatively. for all that, this film was considered a landmark. it doesn't have a history that goes stay forever in our memory, but it was a film that showed to the industry that certain narrative techniques, light, shooting etc. were truly possible.so, my advice is to forget the critics, specialists and experts. forget that is an acclaimed film and see the movie, enjoy the film before you think about it.","a classic among all classics. the epitome of a masterpiece; citizen kane is story telling at it's finest. it is crafted ingeniously clever, acted perfectly, directed and edited to perfection.","finally, i got to watch citizen kane, and there is no confusion about why this is commonly considered one of the greatest films of all-time. i watched many movies that have been described as ""revolutionary""  and ""game-changing"". but besides that citizen kane really deserve to be called so more than any movie i've watched in my life, it's could be the oldest movie that is as influential as it is timeless. i felt i was watching a movie the has been released couple years ago, except it's shot in black and white. an ecstasy of light and shadow, of clashing textures and graphic forms. a haunting cinematography that makes citizen kane one of the best-looking movies to date. an exuberant use of camera placement and movement and inventive lighting. yes, it's above all a visual achievement. but all these innovative techniques shouldn't be questioned whether they still hold up or not. because they don't just hold up to this day, but they are as fresh and contemporary as they were in 1941. but all that is from the technical standpoint, so what about the screenplay, the narrative, the story?as orson welles took many risks directing citizen kane he also took risks writing it's oscar-winning script with herman j. mankiewicz. and of course by risks i mean the unprecedented use of flashbacks, and the non-linear storytelling. and while i can't say this way of storytelling paid off perfectly, i have to admit that this structure has changes the game forever in film-making. it took me a while to be engaged with the characters, and the story itself. that's because the pacing was confusingly fast at the beginning, and some important aspects and details in the story needed to be more focused on. it also dragged, and almost lost me a couple of times. as i mentioned above, the build up for the titular character could've been way better, at least to make me invested in the character from the start.with that being said, the more the time goes, the more i became engaged with the story, and invested in all the characters, not only charles kane. and i couldn't help but hope for some explanation about the fate of kane. after some more minutes, i realized that citizen kane is a character study, actually, a very complex and compelling one. the story became more poignant and moving. by the way, if you still haven't watched citizen kane because you think it's a pretty serious and bleak film, you better watch it asap. because it's actually funny! yes, sometimes it's funny in a cynical way, but it is always a light-hearted movie, and easy to watch. but that doesn't mean it's a feel-good movie at all. as i mentioned, it the story becomes more touching and emotional as it proceeds, and it's represented in a flashback structure to reveal some mysteries about a publishing tycoon's rise and fall who dies corrupt and alone. so i think you get the point.all the performances are impeccable, and orson welles' performance is as terrific as his direction. also, joseph cotten is great as always. also, the dialogue is so clever, and there are a fair share of very subtle lines.citizen kane is far from perfect, imo. nevertheless, it somehow lives up to its reputation as a landmark achievement in film. but what's striking now is how utterly modern it is in direction.

but hasn't aged very well imo. still a must watch for those who love cinema for more than just entertainment.","the last paragraph of the film continues to trace kane ’s lost soul experience, the vast space created by the wide-angle lens; the depth of the potential space formed by the sound; the use of lighting; the hint of the mirror;  the tragedy of the characters is most vividly shaped: susan rejected kane ’s retention and walked through the castle ’s heavy doors. the doors one after another formed multiple frames. susan walked into the night, but there was bright light on his body, which formed a strong  contrast effect.  kane smashed everything about susan, leaving only the glass ball. he walked into the hall. the mirrors on both sides of the hall formed countless lonely and slowly moving images of kane.",لا يدخل هذا الفيلم ضمن قائمة أعظم أفلام التاريخ! والسبب الرئيسي لذلك، أنّ هذه التحفة السينمائية الخالدة العظيمة لا يستطيع المرء ببساطة أن يحشرها مع أي فيلم آخر مهما بلغت عظمته!برأيي المتواضع، حينما يتم تصنيف الأفلام ضمن قائمة ما، يجب وضع خط ماسي تحت فيلم المواطن كاين، ومن ثم البدء بترتيب الأفلام تحت هذا الخط... نعم، أعظم عمل سينمائي عبر التاريخ، التحفة الخالدة,"this film just made an example of nowaday’s films in many ways, pure masterpiece",no review present. no review present. no review present. no review present.,"""citizen kane"" is still topping the best movies of all time list of all respectable film connoisseurs. orson welles' first feature film undeniably set a new bar for hollywood and had a strong influence on film noir. greg toland's cinematography was ages ahead, particularly in his use of shadow, pan focus, and compositing to create depth, and the non-linear storytelling with multiple narrators was a significant innovation for the time. part of the myth was also fueled by the controversy of its satire of william randolph hearst, a newspaper tycoon who heavily influenced public opinion on the spanish–american war.still, it's undeniable that cinema has been evolving and improving ever since, and that the historical value aside ""citizen kane"" is far from being the best film ever. the writing is solid indeed, but the story is static and lacks tension, development, and any kind of emotional impact, offering little more than some sociopolitical reflections on the rise and fall of a fascinatingly ambiguous character. welles also seems to purposedly keep kane's figure as distant as possible to redirect our empathy towards the other characters. it kinds of bothered me that we never get to see real inner conflicts or even crucial moments of his life like the death of his son and parents (only briefly mentioned in ""the news on the march""). it's almost as welles purposedly wanted to keep us distant from the character and redirect the empathy towards the other characters' roles as unreliable narrators.no one can deny that it still looks terrific for a film almost 80 years old, though. just think of the uncanny opening sequence that leads to kane's death, the journalist's visit to thatcher's archive, or kane's self-confinement in the xanadu gilded cage. as the rooms get bigger and bigger, kane is surrounded by fewer and fewer people until he is completely alone dreaming of his parents' boarding house."
The Godfather,"like babe ruth is to baseball, like john steinbeck is to writing, their is no doubt about it, the godfather is the greatest film of all time. never before have we seen performances so stellar, by marlon brando, al pacino, james caan, robert duvall, and everyone else! the godfather has little life lessons everywhere. along with an engaging plot, that just completes the most critically acclaimed film of all time. the godfather is francis ford coppola's masterpiece.","the godfather (1972) is technically a well made film. however, because of its overlong runtime, its barebones plot that is basically just a compilation of the mafia doing things, and pointless scenes, i just can't like it that much.it's well shot, it's well acted, but it's not that great in my opinion.",it's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. the godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. the greatest gangster film ever made. coppola offers a rich and layered look at family and does so with an incredible cast and a meticulous amount of detail. my favorite movie ever made.,i don't know what people see in this movie because it's so boring and non-sense. i don't even saw the 2nd and 3rd movie because this is really anoying.,one of the best films i've ever seen and it's masterpiece story telling from beginning to end and by the end you realize this is what real filmmaking is all about the films direction property built the film does have a rather slow pace but overall a excellent movie,"trama l e historia lenta, una película que la fama y cantidad de referencias, genera mas espectativa de lo que realmente es, una película que esta bien para su época, destacando entre peliculas románticas y western antiguo, pero no mucho en la actualidad","good, but overrated, is boring, simple and weak, is good, but doesn't attract you.","i cant understand when somebody says negative about this movie.to me,it's perfect,the best picture of all times.idea,director,actors,music,composer,make up..everything is ideal!!! i'm lo vin it!","paramount must be run by idiots. who thought that it was a good idea in 2010, when they remastered this masterpiece, to dub again the iconic italian voices of the time (for example the great voice actor ferruccio amendola, that was a superb brando)? the new voices are so cringy that now the movie seems a parody of itself, whereas the original voices were epic and mithical. congrats to paramount. they just killed one of the greatest movie of all the times in their remastered italian version.","usually i like slow paced films, but at some point a movie should draw interest or emotion. there are almost no story peaks that are exciting, suspensful, emotional or whatever. when people die for example, they get killed suddenly out of nowhere, so even before these moments the movie builds up no suspense. many scenes are far too long and forgettable, like both the weddings and many more. even the horsehead had no relevance for anything. the acting is solid but never reaches any remarkable levels. not one of the characters is truly likeable, what makes it difficult to feel for them. in the end i am also a bit disappointed of the camera work: too many wideshots, too less facial close ups and missing overall aesthetics in look and scenery. i feel bad for rating a classic movie like this so low, but i cant see the brilliancy of the godfather.","francis ford coppola has done the best he can with such meagre resources. consider the godfather (and the godfather part ii) as coppola working through his directorial immaturity, on his way to producing his masterwork: the godfather part iii.","the movie of ""the godfather"" delivers a very cliche and overall sadistic message to all those who decide to watch it. either way, i recommend this film for people looking for a good, and unusual, drama film.",this movie is kinda really bad i mean who even is this godfather guy? he's not my godfather,"como ""o poderoso chefão"" é considerado um clássico, não tive como conter as expectativas de que seria um ótimo filme. poucas vezes na minha vida eu me desapontei tanto com um filme.não consigo entender como um filme longo de quase 3 horas de duração não consegue desenvolver seus personagens.a história se resume em abordar a relação dos negócios das máfias, já a relação dos personagens com seus familiares e amigos não é aprofundada, fica algo raso, frio e muito mal feito. sinto como se todos irmãos da família corleone tivessem a mesma personalidade, já que não houve desenvolvimento.minha nota não foi mais baixa por causa da filmagem que foi uma revolução para a época, a trilha sonora é boa e a atuação é boa, mas comprometida pelo não desenvolvimento dos personagens.3.5/10",the movie is perfect. everyone who gave it a 0 are probably the same people that watch fox news and think global warming is fake so there is no point in arguing. either you know movies or you don't.,great movie,"the godfather trilogy (and i'm one of the few who rates iii up there with i and ii) finds a wonderful balance between a well-paced story and some terrific crisis moments for its characters. for those who may be concerned about whether or not they will enjoy it, i'd suggest watching the godfather (part i) while keeping in mind that this is a story about michael wanting to go straight, to be good. to society and to his family.",unexpected death constantly interrupted by elegant music and scenes of rose garden. it is a little bit annoying how dumb women in this movie appear to be.,"absolutely,  positively the greatest movie ever made. every frame is perfection from start to finish. it will never be bettered. there is nothing more to add.","this movie does not deserve a perfect score.  it's a boring overrated movie, seriously, how can anyone understand what brando is saying with all that cotton wool in his mouth, let alone get away with it, he must have been laughing all the way to the bank and taking the p@ss out of everyone with this movie.",thanks to marlon brando who made this movie the best of all times up to date. it keeps getting better the more often you watch it.,best movie ever!,"you know how when a friend is telling you a personal anecdote that he thinks is hilarious, but you don't find very funny, he'll say ""you had to have been there."" that's kind of how i feel about the godfather. by the time i watched this movie i'd seen so many impersonations of don corleone and parodies that it all felt almost comical.  putting all that aside (if that's even possible), i still didn't enjoy this movie. i found myself checking how much more i had to sit through multiple times. and having seen what al pacino is capable of, he seems very wooden in this.  my conclusion is that if you managed to see this movie before pop culture appropriated it and fed you their versions, then you'll likely love it. if like me you weren't around in the 70's, you might not get that much from it. in other words, you had to have been there."," if this movie seems slow to you, you've probably been watching too much contemporary television. this is how movies ought to be paced - organically, and earning their progress. when the godfather is slow, it's because it's trying to share something with us, either a nuance, or a bit of great acting that deserves a few more seconds of screen time. the cast is amazing. the score is famous for a reason. its scenes became cliche for a reason. it won't make you feel better about the world, but damn is this a great example of storytelling.",this movie is perfect just for the loosers that do not not understand a msterpice go ahead and see some homo intented film like the lord of the rings,"it's easy to see why this is the highest rated film. the acting is on another level, the directing is not only gripping and atmospheric but it doesn't cut from one thing to another. everything that's important is shown, all the dialogue, all the detail. the story is obviously what makes this film so great. although not an action movie, some of the scenes make the typical modern hollywood blockbuster look laughable. the film is not only well-directed and clever, but also easy to follow. the story isn't over-complicated with a bundle of events which have no connection. the only reason i'm not giving it a 10 is because it's over 3 hours, and for a film that long you'd expect more to happen. the film can be cut down by about half an hour without losing any narrative or quality.",the best movie in metacritic really is a great movie. francis ford coppola made and aced a great film which is better than his sequels. really well thought and made into a top hit mafia-detective movie. one of ford's best movies.,"i find some negative reviews to be pointless  either yammering on about how ""long"" the movie was, slow is another one (though many of these reviewers being kids and not quite used to the expository routines of late 60's drama) and committing the reviewers sin of comparing it to other hyper-spastic (almost cartoonish) crime dramas like scarface and pulp fiction  though exceptional in their own right.  there is a quality of this film that tributes a long forgotten style of story telling within subtlety; the end result a beautifully woven opera of deceit, betrayal, loss and violence. it is and will always be a film that reaches the highest levels of fiction, wherein the film is preformed....and not spoon-fed to the audience. heaven forbid you'd have to do some actual thinking in order to complete a relatively easy 3 hours of story telling.","violent, well scripted and large, this classic american recounts a dark period in the history of america so perfect and convincing with perfect performances from all his cast this movie will likely be immortal.","a masterpiece. how can the earth continue without coppola's the godfather. one of the most iconic films ever talked about worldwide and acclaimed well by everybody, it's more fun to talk about it.","this film is simply a classic, look at brando, the only disappointment for me is that, this is the only film he features in!. it is the making of al pacino, he graces the screen, the godfather perverts pacino into the dark side, but the process proceeds to ebb away at him . robert duval sits in the back ground, but his loyalty to the family shines through, he doesn't win best supporting for this , but easily could have!. quite frankly, watch this film, a few times, eventually all the detail soaks in. it really is one of the best of all time, once you've seen this, watch the other two, they all for me are classics, learn from them and enjoy!.","the godfather is the perfection of cinematography, with a unique and special gangster style, a respect for the unsurpassed work and a family, a family that revolutionized cinema.","the godfather is, without a doubt, one of the greatest films to have ever been made. the acting by all characters is superb. the plot is convoluted and twisting enough to keep you interested, but not until the point that it becomes too hard to follow. the cinematography and visual effects are equally impressive. while much of this movie is grounded in reality and thus the visual effects are usually pretty standard, there are a couple of shots that are absolutely amazing for the time.brando and pacino's performances of this movie steal the show and both help make this film the masterpiece that it is. in addition, the screenplay is one of the best i have ever seen. oftentimes, in these crime/mafia films, they tend to run on for too long and the viewer becomes bored. despite being a three hour movie, not only was i glued to the edge of my seat each time, but each scene felt integral to the story and themes that the film is trying to tell. further, it feels as if every single *action* taken by a character has an impact on either a theme or the outcome of the movie. this level of screenplay has not been matched by another film that i have seen.in addition the cinematography of this film has resulted in several of the most iconic scenes in all of cinema being brought to the big screen. the number of quotes, iconic scenes, jokes, and memes that came from this film is absolutely amazing.whether it is the greatest movie of all time or not, the godfather is a must see film that has had one of the greatest impacts on modern society and popular culture out of all the films that have ever been made. this is a must see for anyone who enjoys cinema."," the first time i saw this movie, when it first came out 33 years ago, i left the theater after one hour or so, i was bored and confused, perhaps i was too young for this film. today i consider the godfather to be the best movie ever, i'm a fan of the film and i know every character and detail. of course i seen it a hundreds times, in fact it",perfect.,"simply put, awesome movie.",is there really anything better?," this is a perfect score movie for a reason, it is the best movie that has ever been concieved. the score of 80 is not counted as it is an uncerdited and therefore and not from any professional critic, it should be put amongst the user reviews. as for people giving this film a 0/10 i am quite sure that you are pathetic little people that live their lives on the net and hang shit on any movie with any substance or critical acclaim. the impact of this movie, considering it was made in 1972 still has great affect. my sister watched this movie for the first time just a couple of weeks ago and for someone who thinks legally blonde is a good movie to say this is one of the best films she has ever seen just proves it is excellent. coppolla is a legendary filmmaker, many should take a leaf from his book.",excellent movie.,"this movie is the best ever, and it shows its cinematic screenplay brilliance as well as its incredible, dynamic script, a great, amazingly-told storytelling, and a remarkable cast. marlon brando and al pacino star in this four-star crime drama.",absolutely unmatched in its immersiveness. the opening wedding sequence is possibly the finest exposition of any film i've ever seen. this is a film that needs to be shown on the big screen every couple of years.,i think this the best movie ever made. ths is the #1 in gangster films. #1 in movies all around. this is the best movie ever!!!," one of the best movies ever along with godfather ii, and other classics...marlon brando shows off his range and acting versatility by transforming from being a '50s american actor to a convincingly italian mafia man. i first thought he was italian, and i was surprised how un-italian he was prior to his role. so good, that he would adopt this speech into his everyday talk for the rest of his life. that man was a legend. pair him up of al pacino, who was a budding star, and now legend (though he has plateaued ever since scent of a woman, when he won an oscar for saying huah!, when it really should've been for this role, or as tony montana in scarface, in dog day afternoon, in carlito's way, or other). pacino is startling brilliant as a seemingly normal young man who reluctantly joins the mafia, but then takes over the family business and runs it like his own after it was passed down from brando. james cahn was absolutely phenomenal as the hotheaded sonny corleone, and jon cazale as the weak-minded brother fredo. this movie changed the gangsta movie landscape giving a third dimension to previous cop-bad guy, go kill movies, and really gives an insight of what they are about, that being loyalty, trust, bonding, and later turns into power, corruption, greed, and eventually the downfall of michael corleone. none of them are the typical good guy, but all of them are interesting as characters and it engages you wholly into the film and thrusts you into the dialogue, making you never want to take a bathroom break. this is what makes a classic, and if you don't understand the concept of this, than you don't know movies.","this movie is possibly the best movie off all time. it has all of the element of a great timeless classic. it has big stars/soon to become big stars, a great director and an amazing plot! it rightly deserves to be number one!",great movie,best movie ever!,"to simply put it, the godfather is an film that is honed to prefection. it is so good that i no longer have words to describe how amazing the film is. pure greatness. the godfather gets just about everything right in this compelling masterpiece that will be forever remembered and emulated, the godfather of modern films. i can see why this film is so big, so revolutionary, so influential. no other film stands a chance against this monster of a film. the acting is top-notch and the plot, the plot is amazing with a crime-epic tale that will always be remembered, immortalized forever. al pacino and marlon brando give stellar performances in their greatest movie ever. the amount of emotion in the godfather is amazing too as the you clearly feel each character's emotion and are drawn into it. the moments staying forever in your mind because it is so amazing. the godfather reinvents the way i look at movies, my view of them has changed forever as i see how masterful this film is. it crushes every other film, no other film will ever come close to knocking the godfather off its pedestal of greatness. flaws, this sounds mundane but i cannot say it any other way, there are like zero flaws in the film. i scrutinized but could not find any at all. the good aspects deeply mask the film's bad aspects so a perfect movie has been created in a sense, that is amazing. i have not given a movie a perfect 10 out of 10, i have not seen a movie worthy of the all-time high but that changes with the godfather and it is well deserved. overall, the godfather is a flat-out amazing film that will always be beast and smoke every other movie out there, this film will be a film that everyone will mention when asked ""what do you think are the greatest movies of all time?"". the godfather is pure perfection of films honed to the highest aspects. this is not a great movie, this is a revolutionary film, i love it. breakdown for ""the godfather"": presentation: 10, plot: 10, acting: 10, script: 10, lasting

ford coppola.al pacino is a legend whereas marlon brando is an ultra legend,"if not the greatest movie ever made, than certainly the greatest gangster drama movie ever made. you have probably heard that bin said before, and well, it's quite true. now, if your a critic, you pretty much have to like this movie, even if you didn't. i certainly did like it because, one, it gives great performaces, especially by the great marlon brando, and it has a tremendous screenplay that goes deep within its drama and plot points. thrilling also,""the godfather"" is probably one of the best movies of the

Boyhood,"a boy enjoying pictures of women in swimwear with his friends. a boy being devastated after having his mane cut off. a boy debating the necessity of facebook with his high school girlfriend. in all honesty, boyhood is a rather apt title for this film. but it could just as well hold the name of another picture currently running in cinemas: life itself. that simple yet profound thing is what lies at the core of richard linklater’s unique 12-year-spanning story and makes it relatable for everyone, regardless of sex, age group, descent, social status, or character. linklater lets his audience live through the fun and the pain, the love and the misery, and the excitement and the disappointment of his protagonist mason with yet another wonderful screenplay in his repertoire and an unspectacular but still extraordinary way of directing. leaving the cinema, it’s hard to grasp one has just spent the better part of an evening in front of a screen, but at the same time, there’s also a feeling of having relived your own adolescence along with mason.","i was expecting a sort of emotional roller coaster with moments of empathy, sadness, joy, etc. -- having gone through real-life boyhood myself -- but rarely did this film evoke that kind of personal attachment and investment for me.esquire has a q&a with linklater and hawk in their latest issue, and in it they claim to have made a conscious effort to avoid cliches, but somehow they landed on a bunch of them anyway.there are a few great moments, and generally very few missteps, but ultimately this film does not reach the upper echelons of movie lore. it's good, not great.in short, i was expecting to cry. i had the box of tissues ready. never came close.","the movie is complete and utter waste of time. i truly feel sorry for the actors that dedicated 12 years of their life filming such a **** and boring movie. however, they should also be commemorated because this movie may be the cure to insomnia,its that slow. some may argue that slow and steady wins the race,and the only way that could be true for this movie was competing for the **** movie of all time. the fact that 'boyhood' has such good reviews blows my mind, but i figured out why this is so. reviewers feel so terrible that this **** movie took 12 whole years to make they all decided to throw a pity party and hand out 10's.n","3 hours of inept, masturbatory navel-gazing. a one-trick-pony of a movie so intent on patting its own back over how much critics will be baited into loving its ""bold experimentation"" that it forgot to be a film about anything. i never imagined something that took so much time and energy to make could appear so lazy and ill-conceived on screen. ignore the undeserved praise. just because it took 12 years to make doesn't mean it's any good. don't encourage these people and give this a pass.","you know what my favourite part of this film was besides some nice shots of austin, a place i've visited?  the beginning of the ending credits! am i the only to have seen this film as overlong and full of repeated after school special scenarios?  two hours and forty-five minutes of shallow small talk mixed with one-liners one would likelier hear out of a pothead's mouth amounts to a combination of sitting in an elizabethan torture chamber while watching the ""wonder years"".  except the wonder years had more creative plot lines. am i the only one to think how emotionally balanced and level-head those kids were despite having a father who's insufferably loquacious and a mother who's just a plain miserable cow less than apologetically putting her children second?  i like patricia arquette and ethan hawke.  i do not think they make the best sympathetic parents. am i the only one to see the young mason's lack of backbone and failure to stand up to the horrible adult role models his impressionable life?  i'd like to think that a lot of kids would rebel, rather virulently and understandably i should add, at basically being brow-beaten and spiritually abused to death.  it's just not real. no to boyhood.  no to all the adulation the movie has undeservedly received.","i'm utterly mystified by the unanimous raves for this movie by the professional critics. there are beats and performances to enjoy here, particularly those of the children cast in the roles of mason jr and his sister samantha. and there is an innate fascination with watching a boy's face and body become that of a man that is captivating here. but the minute the adults around mason jr start speaking, i just felt like i wanted to leave the room. the parade of inappropriate (or downright terrifying) fathers that march through the story made me wonder at the miracle that young mason would actually survive into adulthood at all. had the brilliance of the concept been matched with a more invigorating and cliche-free screenplay, i too would have rewarded the movie with a 10. as is, it's hard to recommend even investing the 2 hours and 45 minutes it takes to wade through this particular boyhood.","i am absolutely shocked by all of the great reviews. maybe my expectations were too high but i mean the critics loved it and praised it like it was the best movie of all time, when it really is a waste of time.","ground-breaking movie project but i agree with some other users that this should not be the only reason why the film gets over the top reviews. if you do not take into account the effort made in creating this film, it turns out to be a better-than-average one, but not best a best-of-year film. it is a good luck at the reality of parenting and childhood these days, the struggles that fall on both sides, but there are some parts that don't seem to really go anywhere. overall, it's a humbling, emotional, empathetic and thoughtful film but may be a bit too long and ""pointless"" without a plot to appeal to most audiences. it helps to go in with the notion of the effort that this film required, which helps you appreciate it more.","while i don't think boyhood is quite as strong as everyone says it is, it's still a fantastic drama that has achieved something amazing that no movie has ever done- being filmed over the span of twelve years.","everybody who dislikes this movie seems to feel as if they need to make an excuse as to why it is so well received as if it is impossible that somebody disagrees with their opinion. i'm curious what the people who claim that the reviews are solely based on the 12 years concept think about linklater's before series. those movies were not filmed over 12 years but are written very similarly to boyhood and were extremely well received. the truth is that the 12 years adds a real and compelling vibe to an already well written movie. this movie is about how life is made up of little, meaningless moments that go by before we even know it. every scene is so carefully made, as to capture every detail as realistically and compellingly as possible. the movie is simultaneously beautifully nostalgic, and utterly depressing. i've watched it three times and i can't wait to watch it again.","in brief.want to see a great film about boyhood? see this boy's life.want to see ethan hawke's best? see predestination.want to save 3 hours? skip boyhood. i loved before sunset, sunrise, and midnight. but boyhood is not good. do not believe the hype. boyhood gets attention for the gimmick of being filmed sporadically over 12 years, so you get to see the kids in the movie grow up. big whoop. not an ounce of hollywood gloss here. the movie goes for realism in the extreme. homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. it also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. no the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. which was a breath of fresh air. but it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. for awhile there is kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. but after that the film sprawls. example. the dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you'll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. maybe is considering getting back with her? but suddenly the movie cuts; it's years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. i don't know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it's just skipped. despite the title, the film dwells on every family member, so it's not like ethan hawke is a minor character. yet they pass over a giant life event. minor spoiler is now over. yes stories should flow from character, but there should still be a story. character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. aside from the drama early on with the mom's domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. when hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. i left this movie hungry for that cake. and besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. it's just that it's subtle. we didn't get that here. there is no depth of the boy's life plumbed here. just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related. another point. aside from ethan hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. it's one thing not to be disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. a story requires conflict. but much of the activity in this film doesn't rise to the level of actual conflict. instead it's just a manifestation of some kind of low grade depression that never quits and slowly grinds down the teeth on the gears of your spirit. even though the movie is too realistic, in other ways it is too unrealistic. there is oddly stilted fake sounding dialog in the first 20 minutes or so. also, the son (the ""boy"" of the title) encounters adult men who act exactly the same toward him all the time, step dad, teacher, boss, all of them criticize him in exactly the same way, and that's all they do. you could switch out the dialog for all these guys. they are all the same. except ethan hawke. another unrealistic thing. when the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in a movie. this pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young george clooney. it's ridiculous. and they were going for extreme realism? in my own life growing up i encountered some real weird sh!t. so did friends. they say 'sh!t happens' for a reason. but if this is supposed to be this kid's life, either they skipped over that type of dramatic stuff or he had one heck of a mundane childhood! also, these people seem to have no center. if they have values or principles or beliefs, that's skipped over too. there is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don't go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak. there's something off-putting about them from my perspective. they are not like people i have ever known. ethan hawke does a good job acting in boyhood, but why did he agree to do it? predestination, his other new movie, is sci-fi, but it's also a study of character as revealed and developed through a protagonist's response to a crisis. it is stellar, brilliant, the best of the best. i am chalking it up on my list of the very best films (of any genre) that i have seen. it will be right beside before sunset on my blu ray shelf. predestination raised ethan hawke in my estimation, and even boyhood, which i saw a short time later, cannot bring him down entirely. so let me divert you dear reader. see predestination. skip boyhood",don't get me wrong. i like indie movies but this is just way over-hyped. a touch of mass hysteria for a movie that is really just a cool version of reality tv. all just too ordinary. birdman has far more going for it. boyhood is way too long and gives us very little to ponder other than we have all been there. there are so many better things to do with 2 hours and 45 minutes.,sırf 10 yılda çekildiği için bile saygıyı hakeden bir film. zaten hikayesine ve kalitesine söz yok. mükemmel bir başyapıt. her zaman böyle bir film gelmez,"i really have to agree with i hate everything on this one. this is a film about a stereotypical boy's life, and his stereotypical dreams and his stereotypical aspirations, and his stereotypical friends and his stereotypical school life. and don't forget about his stereotypical family. i do admire and appreciate the actors and the crew for sticking with this movie for 12 years. there was a solid performance or two, but that's about how far the good stuff goes.","way, way, too long and vastly overrated.  probably the most overrated movie of all time now.cons: all of the other actors outshine the boy in every scene.  almost every scene is disconnected from the rest of the movie.  it's way too long.pros: partway through, you realize how much this kid has changed, not just in appearance, but in how he acts too.  i saw a lot of myself in him, and sort of felt like i knew him because i watched him grow up.i do see the appeal, in a way, but the cons are pretty big ones.","linklater has given us many amazing cinematic experiences, but this is his masterpiece.  not only is this film a heartbreakingly honest portrayal of growing up, but it should be mandatory for students to watch before graduating from high schoool. even two years after its release, my eyes still water every time i think about this film.  hawke delivers one of his finest performances, but arquette's raw emotion will steal your heart and connect with every person who understands what single-parenting feels like.  in her last scene of the film, arquette delivers a heartbreaking line that will break the heart of every mother (and father) who has raised a child to adulthood. this film will go down as one of the greatest cinematic experiences to ever come out of hollywood, regardless of the spineless oscar voters who under-appreciated this film.","oh dis donc, 12 ans pour faire un film... record battu ! et c'est donc ""ça"" qui fait le buzz puisque les mêmes acteurs et actrices sont venus pointer régulièrement pour aider au remplissage de cette espèce de chronique (?) de la vie quotidienne d'une famille recomposée décomposée et voire plus si affinités.il ne faut par conséquent pas s'étonner que le film dépasse les 2h40, car en vérité, ç'aurait pu être pire... quoique en l'état, ce machin très psycho-social est déjà périmé avant d'être fini ou éventuellement consommé. c'est d'une banalité et d'un ennui rarement atteints et ça n'a aucun intérêt.ni du côté dramatique ou mélodramatique, ni du côté de la comédie, ni... d'aucun côté en fait. on préfère à dire vrai se taper une saison entière de derrick que les deux heures et trois quarts de ce machin qui brasse de la merde à n'en plus pouvoir. c'était bien la peine d'y passer 12 ans... 6 mois auraient suffi. et encore...","the worst movie i've ever seen. complete b.s and completely unrelatable to the childhood of any boy. messed up storyline, vague characters popping up at random points render this movie a very boring watch. the characters are very inconsistent (except ethan hawke) and the movie generally portrays a very bad image of american family values. thus, the movie should've been named ""mason's f**ked up boyhood (boo fri**in hoo)"". and i'm not even gonna bother writing about the ending scene.","""boyhood"" é um verdadeiro prazer televisivo. o público vive uma jornada que segue o crescimento de um menino que se torna num homem. o filme é tão real. tudo no filme é perfeito, incluindo a trilha sonora, o cenário e os atores. ""boyhood"" é um projeto de paixão de richard linklater e mostra a sua atenção em todos os detalhes. os verdadeiros destaques do filme são a atuação de ethan hawke e de patricia arquette, que interpretam os papéis do pai e da mãe na perfeição. um verdadeiro must-watch!","you either simply love this movie or loathe it. personally i loved it. definitely 2014 movie of the year by far. i agree that sometimes it can be dull and its a little long, but such is life. you're watching a boy grow up and figure out what he wants to do with his life, especially after some of the experiences he's seen/lived through. the first 30 minutes are probably the worst part of the movie, after that it's really good. i suggest sticking with it. lots of good quotes all throughout the movie and i feel like it's gotten a lot of praise for accuracy. i'm a little older than mason but growing up, it was similar. i enjoyed some of the things he did/played when i was younger. kinda the way forrest gump did to baby boomers back in the 90's. i feel it's relevant to call boyhood ""this generation's forrest gump."" there's a lot to love in the movie. i'd give it more along the lines of an 8.7-8.8 but figured i'd bump the rating a bit. deserves higher than an 8.1","this show is terrible, don't be fooled by the super high ratings. it's so bad i created an account here on metacritic just to warn you not to waste 3 hours of your life watching this show about nothing. nothing. there is no plot, no character development, no climax, nothing. it sucks. how it was filmed in 12 years does nothing for the **** plot","filmed over a 12 year period, ""boyhood"" is the simple, relatable and extraordinary journey of a boy and his family. the wonderful premise and richard linklater's outstanding direction make ""boyhood"" the year's best film, as of yet, and a sure contender for best picture. one of the best qualities of ""boyhood"" is how well the audience can relate to the characters. i found myself transported back to my own childhood while watching mason grow up before my eyes; whether it was in watching the interactions and typical sibling disputes between mason and samantha or just seeing mason acclimate to the challenges of growing up. another refreshing aspect is how the film's plot doesn't revolve around a sinister villain, winning a championship game or surmounting impossible odds, but rather is simply about the beautiful and thoroughly entertaining adventure of ""boyhood.""","richard linklater has proven himself to be our primary guide to cinematic time travel. whether it’s in his before trilogy which captures the arc of a relationship over a decade or his lighter fare like dazed and confused which looks back on our teenage years through the lens of nostalgia, he has shown an uncanny ability to demonstrate on screen the subtleties of how time affects us all. boyhood, which was shot over twelve years, following characters as the actors that play them literally age, is linklater’s magnum opus. the persistence and determination of the all involved in the production is admirable and they deserve the attention they are receiving, however what is more remarkable is the film itself. a film so modest, light, and carefree and yet so powerful, boyhood is the antithesis of the modern hollywood blockbuster (interstellar) characterized by their pomposity and heavy handedness. here is a film that never claims it is telling us anything and yet in the end tells us everything.","everyone knows this is a film made over 12 years, with the same cast - shot one week or so every year.  other than that,  what's the story?  the mom has bad taste in men, the son has the worst hair cuts in history, and that fake, ""nobody understands me"" angst  that should pass for drama.   this is what's happening to american film - even the alleged good movies are awful.  this is a great film like what - on the waterfront, to kill a mockingbird?  amadeus, chinatown?   it's like every year was written a different writer, or by linklater trying to figure out what to do.  there's no central theme/plot or problem:  a story line that challenges, tears them apart, shows a real portrait of a family in the midst of struggle.   nothing.  without the 12 year gimmick, this film has nothing going for it.   four of us, all film fanatics,  could not wait for it  to end.","earth to critics - boyhood may have been a successful experiment, but it is by no means a masterpiece. a transcendent film should convey some memorable archetypes, and this film, for all its cataloguing of the experiences of growing up as a boy, with a sister, a mother, and several fathers - one biological, and the others there chiefly to display male shortcomings - comes up with few, if any. despite the protagonist's criticisms of facebook - valid enough, in my view - the movie resolves into a timeline as much as anything else. it's not that i did not enjoy the movie - it was perfectly entertaining. however, this is a film review site, and as such desperately needs some balance in the assessment of this particular offering.","i just spent 5 minutes making this account, just so i could diss the 3 hours i wasted on this awful, boring movie. i think i could've filmed an equally good movie about day to day life","totally understand the raves for the groundbreaking technique -- filming over so many years -- but i found this film pretty depressing. one critic says it ""hold(s) up a mirror to the human condition,"" to which i can only lament that i hope not all boys are surrounded with adults who are pretty much screwed-up a--holes. the casting also falls short, as the children do not look at all as if they were produced by ethan hawke and patricia arquette. all that said, it is really interesting to see the characters age and change, though the profundity (to me) falls short of linklater's ""before sunset."" final note: the soundtrack is extremely well done. it doesn't hit you over the head with songs of the different eras, but weaves music together artfully.","easily the best movie i have watched in a long time. it's deep, thoughtful, realistic, but not heavy-handed. i like how there's really no moral to the story. as someone who had a somewhat disjointed childhood (like mason), this is what actually happens. when you grow up, things are generally fine. you bear some scars from the experience but overall you just move on.",more of an experience than a movie. it was brilliant to see the cast grow and develop over twelve years. last year the winner of best picture was 12 years a slave seems funny that boyhood the front runner to this years race had its cast and crew be slaves to the film for 12 years.,"in 2002,richard linklater has an idea  of a film that became the greatest gimmick in movie history. journey a long with a six year old boy growing up in an awkward way.the movie is beautiful but nothing interesting.get ready as this film force you to watch a boy who grows up and that's about it. but the movie.the movie has no plot or even the fun out of it,it's just a gimmick that works i think whiplash is much better than this.i gave it a mixed review cause it has potential and yes it is a beautiful film but it lacks the magic and the plot(i think).","i realy really dislike this movie , 12 years of making really makes all critics blind, this movie really has no plot, those people suffering from insomnia are suggested to see this movie","this movie is completely, utterly, boring. there's literally nothing that happens. it's about a boy living an extremely dull and cliched life. there's virtually no drama that happens throughout the entire movie, and the drama that is presented is still quite listless and unimportant. in other words, this movie is about as plot-less as a movie can get. it took twelve years to film, and yet, those years span by quickly and dully, one event after the other, with no point or order, just chaotic and random. but what makes the movie so dull was the main character. in the movie, there is nothing bad happens to the main character, nothing to make you connect with him. there's nothing life changing. in fact, the three biggest ""bad"" things that happen to him are that his mother can't find ""the right guy"" (after divorcing his father, she marries her college professor who turns out to become a drunk, and then she marries one of her own college students, who turns out to have mental stability problems due to him serving in the military; both of which she ends up divorcing as well), and his father sells the car that he had thought would be his when he turned sixteen, and his girlfriend cheated on him, which resulted in their relationship ending. other than this, nothing happens. he literally goes through life showing as little emotion as possible, just floating by, as though he was in a coma, or constantly tired. so, finally, after two hours and thirty mintutes, you come towards the end of the movie. the ""boy"" is now an adult who has graduated high school and who is going to be going to college. upon him packing his last things, his mother breaks down saying that there's nothing more that is going to happen with her life. that her life has just been a series of events: her having her children, her divorcing her husband, her raising her children, her marrying a man, divorcing  him, raising her kids some more, marring her college student just to divorce him as well, and finally, her sending first her daughter to college, and then her son. then she concludes with saying that what comes next is, ""[her] funeral."" to this, the boy, replies that she's off by forty years, ""or something."" then she says that, ""[she] expected there to be more."" the movie then cuts to him driving on the road to college. when he finally arrives at college, he meets his new roommate, who is friendly and invites him to go hiking with his girlfriend and another friend (who is also a girl). when mason (the main character) sees that she's pretty, he decides that he'll go. before he goes, his new roommate hands him a hallucinatory mushroom and says that by the time they reach the mountains, it will have an effect. it then fast forwards to them walking to the mountains and we see that mason and the new girl are getting along very well. then it cuts to them sitting and chatting. across the distance, he sees his roommate yelling into the wind, and he begins to talk to this new girl, named nicole, about how we need to, ""seize the moment."" nicole replies with saying, ""i think moments seize us,"" and it shows mason thinking for a moment, and then it cuts to the end credits. i think what bothered me the most about the film was the fact that, despite it having no order, there was a point, but it wasn't that great of one. mason, who lived his entire boring life on coasting mode is finally forced to see that if he keeps doing this, he will end up like his mom––just living, but not truly alive in the sense of being satisfied with life. the point is that we need to let the moments seize us, and we need to live. yet, what made this theme so irrelevant was the fact that there was hardly a moment for him to have ever seized! there was no bad, barely any good, nothing that would have made is life have any significant meaning. by the end of the movie, you ask yourself, ""is my life really this boring?"" and do you know what my answer was? ""no, there's more drama in mine."" in conclusion, if you want to see a long movie that drags on and on about a boy just living his life, then you'll love this movie. even though it had a theme presented at the end, in my opinion, it just wasn't enough to save the movie overall. it is sad really, because it was such an ambitious project. but by creating such a dull life where nothing happens, i feel that they wasted those twelve years, because in all actuality, most people's lives are far more chaotic and show signs of actual character development due to things that happen, both good and bad, in their lives. that's what this movie failed to do: deliver on experiences that are worth watching. what's left instead is dull, listlessness that fails to satisfy someone who wanted to be entertained. i wanted to see sadness, hopelessness, as well as extreme elation and happiness. to see someone grow into a great person despite and because of circumstances. what i got was boy coasting his entire life though a movie that has a run time far too long.","one of the worst movies i have ever seen. bad acting, terrible script, no plot, too long. cheesy after-school special scenes with cliche, one-dimensional characters. the loveable loser dad. the single mom who has to pull herself up by the bootstraps. the a-hole abusive 2nd husband. what a joke. and don't get me started about the kid. i don't give a rat's ass about the boring brat. negative stars.","i am convinced that all the critics are giving this bouquets because they are scared not to. i mean, it's linklater and it's a 12 year project and it's so frightfully ""well observed"". but did we observe anything interesting, or insightful...really? come on, really? the early promise that we'd see the boy grow through the emotional impact of divorce and domestic violence and being slightly unconventional, but it never eventuates and ultimately it all just leads to your common or garden teen's self indulgent prattling. there were some terribly clever things going on, especially the editing of the time jumps, and i was always curious to see how the actors had aged, including the next hairstyle choice.on the positive linklater didn't take us down conventional routes, there was no 'coming of age sex scene"" for example, or any 'teen makes bad judgement call and gets into trouble' scene. but neither has he built any significant conflict. i wouldn't call this film an utter waste of my time, but i've no idea what people are raving about.","boyhood embodies greatness. it inspires and exhilarates. it is poignant and uplifting. boyhood celebrates life like no other and examines its often obscure meaning. the film chronicles the fictional life of mason from age five to eighteen. the plot follows his coming to age and the turmoil it often brings. this film is unique when it comes to story telling because it was filmed over the course of twelve years. this allows the film makers to experiment like no other and exemplifies to its audience the real time that passes in between scenes. you watch as mason matures and you develop a deep connection with him that is almost universally unrivaled by other films. i became so engrossed in his character that the nearly three hour run time felt like mere minutes. boyhood is brimming in high quality. richard linklater directed this film flawlessly. his direction highlights the emotion of  the film and projects life into it’s characters. linklater’s screenplay also perplexes the characters and is filled with memorable dialog and subtle wisdom. the combination of these elements defines the film and its soul. the assembled cast is also top notch. ethan hawke and patricia arquette star, and newcomer ellar coltrane plays the title role of mason. the chemistry between the actors is unmatched and it only continues to evolve as the film progresses. boyhood is a celebration of life, from its triumphs to it’s heartbreak. it inspires us to live and as the film so eloquently put it “let the moment size you”. boyhood instills its soul into every frame. it teaches us that life worth living. it shows us that beauty is all around us and we simply just have to let go to experience it. boyhood is unlike anything that has proceeded it and likely unlike anything that will follow. it is revolutionizing in every sense of the word and is undeniably the best film (thus far) this year and possibly of this decade. i can not urge you enough to experience this monumental piece of art.","linklater has made the movie equivalent of the emperor's new suit!. ""it is very beautiful"" say the critics but there is nothing resplendent to be seen here! in fact, there is nothing of merit to be seen at all because the movie isn't wearing any artistic clothes. who has the courage to stand up and proclaim that boyhood is naked?","if this is what is to grow up in america, it ""really sucks"". this is not a true depiction of life, some really good acting combined with allot of bad acting. allot of irritating scenes, especially in the beginning. it shows how undisciplined children in the u.s. are, and the lack in parenting. i hated this movie, and considering it took 12 years to make, that gave the director ample time to edit out the bad parts, which he didn't. this movie doesn't deserve the praise it got, especially not directing wise. any idiot could picked up a camera and shoot a film like this. appalling.","well, no matter how much work you put into it, if it's not good, it's not good... and doesn't deserve accolades for effort... i've seen some of linklaters and malicks films and i'm not a fan... not to say i have to be, but if you're going up for an award some things should be paramount... (tree of life is still the worst award nominated film i've ever subjected myself to)... a plot would be nice... a story... a payoff... consistency... competent acting... believable dialogue... character development... motivation are just a few things i'd expect in an award nominated film...  it didn't take me on a journey... it showed me a series of pointless scenes to show a passage of time... seemed like a lot of it was written (or ad-libbed) as they went (later confirmed to a degree by his daughter)... the liberal agenda (which i mostly agree with) was stuck in there too obviously and made it feel even more like a really bad lifetime movie... reading the reviews, it comes across as people pretending to like or understand the film to fit in, be in the know or appear smart... i prefer to take a serious look at this and be truthful... i was looking forward to the film... i read the hype, was excited about the premise and am fan of new exciting film ideas... but they have to be well executed... (that's the thing)...i'd like to know what about this film was done well? linklater had 12 years to plan out a script, story, plot... to direct the actors to better performances... he had a $4 million budget (with no stunts, sfx, costumes, sets, etc)... he made the most basic of films types: i dialogue-driven drama with no costly name actors... there is no excuse... if i come across harsh, it's because this film received so much unwarranted or deserving hype and rave reviews... had this won at a film festival and went to dvd, great.... good for them... for this to be beating out other great films for awards (and for acting and directing too?!?!?!), it deserves some questioning into what the hell are people liking about it? is linklater blackmailing everyone? were all the critics bribed? is he best friends with kim jong un? this film fails to exceed in any of the categories set forth by the awards shows... i'm so glad the sag awards are coming soon, so i can gauge how it'll do up against some other greats films... i don't think i can stomach the oscars if boyhood is a frontrunner... does this film have any rewatchablilty for anyone not involved with the production? were they any ""positive"" stand-out performances? powerful moments? surprises/twists? engaging story? characters to care about? one last question i'd like to pose...taking out the fact that all the main actors were available to work at various points within a 12 year period; that is, no one died or decided to quit (though linklater's daughter wanted her character killed off because she didn't want to do it anymore, to which he said 'no, it would be too powerful for the film' - so instead, nothing happens)... what exactly about his movie was done well or successful?","boyhood is a journey through one of the most stunning, honest, and brutal time capsules ever made. to see ellar coltrane grow up before our eyes... it's one of the most inventive pieces of film in recent history. richard linklater has made magic.",one of the most revolutionary movies of the cinema history. . as you watch and see how people change you progressively fall in a more deep enchantment. boyhood is simply a masterpiece that you will remember for ever and that will become a classic cult movie as time goes by. 10/10,"this is the first richard linklater film that i have watched, he's got a lot of noteworthy films like dazed and confused, school of rock and before sunrise. boyhood is such an inspirational take on life in general and it gets standout performances out of ellar coltrane, patrica arquette and ethan hawke.","on the one hand, being so eliquently reminded that life is what it is, that our own daily struggles are shared and relevant, is certainly worthwhile. that the film is getting so much acclaim is suprising, given the lack of any crisis and somewhat tedious screen time of nearly 3 hours","at the end of the movie, as the main character mason jr. (ellar coltrane) is sitting with an attractive young girl named nicole. nicole suggests that instead of people seizing the moment, the moment seizes the people. mason smiles, and agrees. this is boyhood. that one little dialogue summarizes the entire movie, and if used applicable, life itself.when one watches this film, you don't think towards what's going to happen next, you are completely enraptured in whatever scene is going on. you are fully and totally devoted to the movie and the characters in it. as you watch the movie, you begin to get attached to mason and by then end of the movie, you start rooting for him unlike any other character. you not only want him to succeed, you want to make sure  that he's taken care of, and that he finds his way down the right path in life. this movie captures you like no film has, or ever will","boyhood made me want to enjoy life, to get off the couch and really find what i want to do with my life. it made me want to get out of my house and meet new people. thanks to this film i´m now really scared of dying knowing that there´s a lot for me to experience.i have never been able to relate to a story and its protagonists as much as i did with boyhood and while some people may find it ""boring"" or ""too long"" but for me it was perfect. and the fact that they used the same actors for all the film just adds more to the awesome this film is.so thank you everyone who contributed for this. thank you","this film is an absolute masterpiece. being about the same age as mason, i found that this film and his story reflects my entire generation. it has its dull moments and its exciting moments throughout this story, but that is what life is; it's subtle at times and game-changing at other times. and if you had to pick one film that showcases life, it's ""boyhood."" no matter what age you are, you can't help but seeing aspects of your own life in the lives of this family. these actors put twelve years of their lives into the portrayal of these original characters. and if that isn't the performance of a lifetime, i don't know what is. patricia arquette deserves the oscar for best supporting actress for her performance as olivia, mason's mother; her acting has a perfect combination of subtlety, realism, and emotional depth. it was so difficult to put my feelings about this film into words, because it is just that remarkable and revolutionary. richard linklater has the right to call this film his ""mona lisa.""","i can’t deny that this is a film one of a kind. i’ve never seen a movie that has so much character development as this one has. it’s just amazing watching how the kid actually grows up and gets older in front of your eyes, and all the acting is pretty great. i can’t imagine all the commitment that everyone had to put in this movie during all those eleven years of shooting. that’s more than enough to go watch this movie one time. sadly, besides that, the movie is a little boring. yes, it’s very cool to see the kid get old, but the film itself is not breathtaking. it’s just about a normal kid’s life in the usa, since he is in school, until he goes to college. i’m very happy because i watched this film a first time, but i wouldn’t watch it again.","it's fun to see how the character played by the same actor develops in the film. but in my opinion the experiment did not produced positive outcomes, what you are left with is with a movie without any feeling with mediocre acting and even worse writing. it is unbelievable that this much effort and time was invested so we could compare a movie with looking at a family's photo album. i don´t recommend watching this movie, a complete waste of my time.","really wanted to like this film based on all the praise and liking some of linklater's earlier films, but the unanimous critical praise should be the first clue that the reviews are a herd-like following of other reviewers rather than looking at the movie apart from the name branding and previous praise heaped upon it.  if you like wasting 2 hours and 45 minutes of your life watching contrived, cliched and poorly written scenes and actors then this is your movie.  if you want to see people age over 12 years, looking through your own family albums would be a much better use of time than suffering through this mess.  universal acclaim = critic/review failure.","it's a perfect hallmark film but nothing more. i don't know why are there so many good reviews. when the film was started i though that it can develop, but no, it's just boring and pointless. i hated the characters, the whole plot, it's very unrealistic and a bad-king mixture of stereotypes from the american films","this movie is so monotonous and boring that i'd rather sit and watch grass grow that watch it. surrounded by awful characters and terrible acting, this  movie in no way deserved to be nominated for an oscar. i admit it that the 12 year filming thing was an amazing idea and i agree that a lot of hard work had gone into this, but come on, it barely has a good story line. i'd rather take a look at my boring life that watch somebody else's."
Three Colors: Red,"enjoyed and satisfied by this trilogy,honestly my favourite was blue,but for me red is the best among the three existing movie. i prefer to feel the emotional attachment that is caused by a lovable character. the relationship valentine-kern also very well established. nuance that is built through the theme of brotherhood in this movie also made me much more like red than his two predecessors. if blue feels depressed and white feels a bit loose and too light, then red is really touching and glamorous. of course, ending in this film as well magnificent. no need to be a crazy twist to so surprising. no need for a scene so touching melodrama. yes, the moment in which the blue, white and red met made me surprised, amazed, touched. moreover.","this movie is amazing, very beautiful, and natural, one of the best movie ever, very recommended movie to watch and to learning.",red is truly a masterclass work from director krzysztof kieslowski. it tells a unique tale about morality and friendship. i highly recommend it.,trintignant carries the mysteriousness of this film to perfection.  an interesting tale of morality.  the production is captivating and the parallel themes work together well to make it an attention holding view.,a boring movie with veeeery slow pace and an unimportant story. nice to see switzerland during the 90s.,"a visual dazzle, a sea of complexity and an marvelous epilogue for this fantastique trilogy, principally for the genial movie's final.","a perfect film, from script to direction. one of the most affecting and absorbing stories i've ever experienced, with impeccable execution in every element. one of the most acclaimed works of cinema ever and one of my absolute favourites. krzysztof, thank you.","a survival instinct..trois couleurs: redkieslowski's final step to its dramatic trilogy is more soothing and lighter than any of its installment. if the previous ones depicted the ideologies of the aftermath of catastrophic events and a subjective procedure of how to survive them, this one at least grabs your attention with a lighter perspective. nevertheless, the gist remains the same, the method is more subtle and complex than the previous ones. this one is made to make you sweat on your seat. it demands you to be on the edge of your seat. it is a tale that makes you think. the argumentative conversation, morally complex situation and ethically challenged solutions, this one is much more talkative and yet is still inexpressive than any of its chapter.it is way too layered and mature than we usually get. this final death sentence of the trilogy, is a remarkable revelations on terms of storytelling. kieslowski has much more shakespeare in him than it comes off. he takes those same emotion and impute them at different situations and different characters, and projects the range and parallel nature of that single emotion. the narrative is adaptive and layered with sharp conversations that amps up the charge to a whole new level. there is more ruggedness in here, despite of it not being that sinister and dark than its previous chapters.it stands alone in the entire trilogy. this one is brighter and sweeter, it doesn't demand attention, it just keeps pulling you back in with its unstoppable force. trintignant is a threat on screen, he can be mean as a street but his nurturing is quite mellow. his ideologies are off track and yet sane than most of the characters. but personally, i prefer, jacob's simpler and honest character. the innocence of hers that is latter filtered by the outer perspective, is just one of the best bits of the feature. trois couleurs: red is the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, it has a survival instinct.",very strange and good movie. love the way how main characters are presented. deep and meaningfull.,nice film with good actors and very interestic scenario. good footage.exelent,"we often think of another person when we say ""i love you"". there are too many lies and deceptions in our lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Vertigo,"hands down one of the all-time greats. every time i see this film, it offers me something new. just so far ahead of its time.","i fully understand that it was a ""shocking suspense"" by the time it made it's way to the cinemas, but nowadays - in 2019 - it's not so great. characters are a bit plain, the plot is slow and only partially interesting, but the worst thing is that zoom... of course, it was something new back in the day, new and interesting, but now it looks like hitchcock is treating audience as stupid, like ""look at this, it's important"". it'd be bearable if it'd be done once or twice, but this movie is full of scenes like this, slowly zooming in and telling you to pay attention. okay, mr h., i got that.","avoid watching any trailers for this, to retain maximum impact. the story is best consumed as a suspense/mystery, layered with great photography and a memorable string-heavy orchestral score. when a film retains its influence 60 years after release - you know its going to be good.","it's compreehensive ""vertigo"" being considered by many people as best movie ever made. i don't know until where it's truth, but that's a great one, it is.","“vertigo” is one of those films that you are forced to give a full score to if you want to look like someone who understands cinema. the cinematography is extraordinary for the time, but that’s the case with most of hitchcock’s works. the meticulous camerawork goes along with the structure of the film, with wide angles that follow scottie’s eyes through the investigation, warmer closeups after he finds love, and again wide but this time disorienting cuts in the third part as the mystery unfolds and scottie loses his mind. the theme of the “spiral“ associated with the feeling of vertigo is also recurrent both visually and narratively. technicolor is used as an expressive means, with vivid and vibrant colors standing for scottie’s passion and fantasies, and dark, pale palettes once he faces reality in the ending. judy is often associated with different shades green, bright for her dress as madeleine, dim when she connects with carlotta at the cemetery and at the museum. during her iconic metamorphosis scene in the hotel room, the green neon lights paint the whole room in an eerie, unnatural tint that creates an uncanny atmosphere and points out scottie’s twisted desire to connect to an otherworldly dimension. the camera uses broad pov angles when following the eye of the investigation, changes to warm close-ups when love begins, and then switches back to wide but disorienting frames as scottie starts getting lost. these are all pretty common techniques in modern filmmaking, but that found one of their first mature expressions here. the special effects and painted sceneries surely show their limits, but are also used tastefully in the memorable nightmare sequence.unfortunately, the script and acting are not up to par, at times leaning towards soap-opera level melodrama. the film is indeed a fascinating mystery that masterfully portrays a woman’s inner conflict and a psychopath’s pathetic obsession for something that is not real (his attempt at “resurrecting” madeleine by humiliating judy as a woman, his lifetime search for a love that is not ordinary despite having someone who truly cares always beside him). however, i couldn’t feel for the mawkish sentimentalism and soppy love story at all. while it’s clear that there is no deep connection between the two from a rational point of view, the film keeps forcing it on you idealizing their passion with corny dialogues and music. everyone just remembers herrmann’s hypnotic opening theme, but the rest is just your average hollywood melodrama.these issues might be marginal for a film that, after all, reflects the taste of a sixty-year-old hollywood, but prevented me from considering “vertigo” as a timeless masterpiece.","an autentic shocker of suspense from the one and only master. james stewart in one of his ""top of the mountain"" roles, as a detective hunted by his worst fears. also remarks the title sequence by saul bass, kim novak, and the score by bernard hermann. at side of spirited away and lawrence of arabia, one of shall see before you die... or else!","rewatching hitchcock movies in a row, this one does not for me stand up to the best.  he mastered the disaster movie (the birds), the slasher (psycho-the first slasher movie), the spy movie (north by northwest), film noir (shadow of a doubt), the thriller (strangers on a train), the voyeur (rear window) but to me this one is boring.  lots of cool scenery, postcard backgrounds.  i loved kim novak as the love starved pretty girl when i was younger but now a hot girl who cannot find love seems implausible.  i get tired of jimmy stewart, he is always skeptical about something.  the opening is amazing, you can see it referenced in the matrix, how better to be scared of something than see somebody die that way.  i also did not like ""dial m for murder"" or ""rope"" but the 39 steps was great.","this movie is freaking long and obscure, which perhaps only make it greater...","an exceptionally well-made film. while it’s not as entertaining on first viewing compared to other hitchcock films like rear window and psycho, it lends itself to closer inspection and theorizing with its seemingly infinite layers of subtle messages and themes. great performances from stewart and novak guided by the typically pristine direction of hitchcock and a perfect score and script make this one of the best films ever made. the score i give is more down to personal preference, more a feeling than anything else.","the best, greatest thrilling mystery romance movie ever made! with the best movie score ever composed!","without doubt this was the best movie i've ever seen. although hitchcock's each movie is better than the other but i strongly believe that vertigo was his masterpiece. there isn't any bad point about this movie i or anyone can say. its directing,music,etc all were great.","your head is not going to stop even a second. if you are a psychological thrillers lover, i must highly recommend it to.","the combination of the beautiful backdrop, plot, and performances from james stewart and kim novak all contribute to one of hitchcock's greatest ever cinematic masterpieces.","vertigo is honestly a masterpiece, i loved the story, i loved how scotty ferguson (james stewart) gets obsessed over this woman after the events happen to her and how it changes him throughout this film. also, i think the cinematography from robert burks is honestly beautiful throughout this masterpiece of a movie. overall, i feel like this movie didn't make me feel bored for a second because it's quite an interestingly good movie from start to finish, it's honestly worth the watch.",بهترین فیلم جنایی تاریخ سینما با داستانی شگفت انگیز و تعلیق فراوان و بازی فوق العاده بازیگران خصوصاً جیمز استوارت و پایانی شگفت انگیز و ارائه بی نقص و جذاب   داستان توسط آلفرد هیچکاک که دیدن این فیلم را برای هر مخاطب سینما اجباری می کند,"i remember watching vertigo with my mom when i was about 13 and still wet-behind-the-ears in most respects when it came to film. i remember my mom holding this movie in an unusual esteem and personal engagement that she so rarely held anything in. my mom was my mom though, and when she loved something, she really loved it, more than anyone has loved anything else, and this, to her, was one of those movies. i didn't fully get it as a kid. where movies were supposed to make you feel emboldened and secure in your values, this strange new kind of movie flew in the face of that, and seemed to like making you feel cold, naked, and dumb.it's been years since then, and i've seen this movie quite a few times. it's the perfect, endlessly-rewatchable thriller. knowing the conclusion to the whole affair actually improves, holding the audience captive in perfect suspense, with each insidious narrative turn tightening the noose around the audience's neck. and when the conclusion does arrive, the first-time unassuming audience is shocked, but not offended. all along there were clues, inaccuracies that could only possibly amount to one conclusion. it's not so much that the audience forgets these clues as much as they choose to forget these clues, preferring one ""truth"" over another.it's this predicament that our protagonist, scottie ferguson, finds himself. however, his actions run perpendicular to the audiences wishes, turning up every stone, prying at every loose end until inevitably he undoes whatever happy ending he wrote for himself. it's his feverish search for ""the truth"" that makes him such a tragedy, and, to his friend and living-partner midge, a comparatively well-adjusted, capable woman, such a mystery. he's the kind of paranoid, troubled individual who gets by on the notion that people are never really paying attention to the right things. his ""truth"" here is the mystery of one madeleine elster, a wife of an old friend who he (meaning the friend) believes to be possessed/hypnotized/some odd thing. less important to scottie are the specifics, choosing instead to understand a ""bigger picture"" that chronically eludes him.hitchcock's direction perfectly compliments the sadness and claustrophobia of the film, which is shot in film's favorite city, san francisco, which just so happens to be my home city. the film prefers quiet over loud, dimly lit, gothic cathedrals with narrow, dark corridors, paired with voyeuristic figures looking on like a moth attracted to lit. it prefers empty city streets and lifeless, seemingly abandoned docks. it's the city as intimate and naked as it comes. not so much norman rockwell as it is edward hopper, the film is photogenic as all-get-out, but unbearably lonely. the lighting enhances the mood, using shadows at the edge of the screen to draw its figures together, obscuring desired women-as-objects under sickly green curtains. vertigo take its audience's plaintive hopes for some virtue or nugget of personal triumph, and, rather than lazily turn it against them, draws upon our collective sadness for inspiration. in the end, scottie is an everyman, living only to view goodness and light through some distant lens, and is simply the victim of being too observant, too clever, and too skeptically honest to ever really leave well enough alone. he's an emblem of the eternal shifting mass of the chronic, who remain miserable in their search for fulfillment, yet blinded by its need for closure. when the ideal presents itself, reality follows, ever-mocking, ever-naked in its approach.",one of hitchcocks greatest masterpieces. everyone who loves movies should have watched this.,"he combined the zoom and the moving lens to shoot a stairwell lens from top to bottom, which successfully caused the protagonist's dizzy psychological feeling of fear of heights.  his method is to lay the stairwell model sideways, the camera is aimed at the stairwell, and slowly push the model at a distance, and the zoom lens starts at the telephoto (telescope head) and slowly pulls it into a wide angle.  it must remain the same on the screen.","in my opinion,vertigo is the best hitchcock`s film.it has the most beautiful cinematography of all his films.i like everything about it.the roles were played in stunning way.","a beautiful storytelling with mystery and thriller elements. tho some parts were left unused, this is a must watch drama of old and essential cinema.",another masterpiece by director alfred hitchcock. this movie is really a weird and good work. i watched it many times.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Singin' in the Rain,so far the best musical film ever. i can't get any words to describe how beautiful this movie is. only thing i regret now is that i didn't watch this movie sooner.,"this film is, for me, the second best musical film of all time, only being surpassed by ""the sound of music"". the story is based on a real fact: the rise of sound cinema and the consequences it has brought to an endless number of actors and actresses, whose bad voice or diction wouldn't allow their career to continue. the film stars gene kelly, debbie reynolds and jean hagen, who bring to life a love triangle that supports the entire film. the script is extraordinary and doesn't deserve critical, as well as the cast performance. kelly and reynolds solidified their stardom with this film, in all fairness, for they are amazing together and excellent when separated. jean hagen gives life to some of the film's most hilarious moments. as far as music and songs are concerned, they are truly beautiful and some of them are in the ear. it is not by chance that most of the songs in this film have gone to the history of cinema and have become as immortal as the movie itself.","this is maybe the best musical of the history,great performances,great music and great dance.","super entertaining classic. holds up no matter how many times i see it.  not only one of the greatest movie musicals of all time,  imo , this is one of the greatest comedies of all time.  can you spell hyperbole ?   joyous fun from start to finish, and a heartfelt look back on hollywood history","assisti esse filme em 2018 e é simplismente sensacional, uma grande química por parte de kelly, reynolds and o'connor, atuação incrivel, enredo. é um dos melhores filmes musical de todos os tempos até lançar la la land que o teve como inspiração singin' in the rain.","such a joyous and entertaining film that might become a tad too cheesy and silly at times, but that's just part of its charm. the ""singin' in the rain"" scene was wonderful, i really liked the hollywood satire and the depiction of the troubled transition from silent cinema. the psychical performance by o'connor in the ""make 'em laugh"" scene was incredible, and much of the comedy still works very well today and is quite witty. it's filled with charming musical numbers and impressive choreography, and it's such a joy to watch gene kelly, reynolds and o'connor grace the screen. a timeless film.","a musical masterpiece of chemistry and choreography between kelly, reynolds and o'connor.  something for everyone in this grand feel-good production, performed impeccably.","what a night! ladies and gentlemen, what a night..singin' in the rainan epitome to a musical genre feature where choreography, production design and background score blends into the perfect combination in a poetic tone. the journey and the transition depicted in here of all the characters; as they aren't palpable to their surrounding anymore, is written explicitly on paper by betty comden and adolph green. and the rest of it is left to stanley done and gene kelly; the directors, whose enthusiasm and affection towards the musical acts is crystal clear and they fortunately are able to apply it all in here. gene kelly has done a decent work on performance too with debbie reynolds and jena hagen as a supporting cast but the real game changer is donald o'connor who is flat out hilarious in his portrayal. singin' in the rain is one of those rare art that just happen to have everything in the right place and if accounted into one big musical opera there lies a genuine soul in it.","a tribute to musical theatre as a genre. don, cosmo and kathy are the ones who naturally love acting, singing and dancing. in this way they turn their lives into works of art. a tribute to movie as a medium. in the number ""you were my lucky star,"" as don puts the light on, you can see how he uses movie production to achieve a dreamlike illusion. a tribute to life. with nature, true love and self-reflexive arts, this movie empowers every art lover.","my favourite film/ musical.

City Lights,"started with modern times and found the comic genius of charlie chaplin. i've seen his movies before but they were mostly a blur. now that i have revisited them i found a newfound appreciation for this era (somewhat). from the kid to the gold rush, all his movies have laughs and heart, something i never thought i'd find in comedies. city lights takes the cake for me sharing a slice of it with modern times.the tramp in some scenes might come off as a booze-drinking, cigar-chomping klutz but this is only because of his selflessness that leads him into these circumstances putting him in one comedic situation to another. what i love about this movie is the relationship he develops with a blind flower girl which blossoms (pun intended) into something pure and innocent. this contrasts his relationship with the millionaire who takes him galavanting, often leading into trouble. don't let the lack of color and spoken dialogue fool you, this movie packs a lot of heartfelt moments, further cementing charlie chaplin's place in cinema history. must watch.","day and night. day and night. this is how the film travels making sure that both of them are present at once.city lightscharlie chaplin's boxing match is not a serious match. i know that's obvious. but it is not. not expected. at the back your thoughts, you are always waiting to get things serious. gritty. bloody. brutal. intense. and it is these films that makes us expect these things from a genre as such. not even touching the rocky milestone, i am just playing around raging bull by martin scorsese and battling butler by michel keaton- someone from charlie's days itself. they've all tried to plaster the sincerity of that job on screen. you can joke around, fool around as much as you like but that sport is respected with a jarring punch when the time comes.not to say that charlie doesn't respect it. his method of living up to that ""dutiful"" objective is somewhat different. nay, not different. mature. ahead of time. he doesn't pay homage to those heavy lifters by putting them in the ring, but does it so elegantly in the dressing room. from hard work to the stakes that are played every night on the screen, everything is mocked or more accurately notified in charlie's dictionary. there is a sense of pride in carrying that note.and maybe that is why he has crafted such an empathetic and a low key character in the rest of the screen time. he is wreck but an adoptable one. another thing that makes this film incredibly different than the others is the jokes. all the jokes are an elaborative comic sketches that takes energy along with time for it to work, from you. and then there is the end of the tunnel in the city lights. a purely unconditional and innocent act that penetrates your emotion as that good old symbol of love arrow does. the birds fly and sing by merrily.","the best, greatest inspiring romcom movie ever made! with the best movie character ever portrayed: charlie chaplin as the tramp! and the best movie score ever composed!","muito bom, amo desde criança, sou vooooooooooooooooooooooioooooooooiioiooooooioocriado nesse filme",the very best inspiring romcom movie ever made! with the best movie character: charlie chaplin as the tramp! and the best movie score ever composed! greatly acted,so sweet and sad on so many different levels. this could be playing with your emotions by the original way of charlie chaplin. you dont wanna miss this,"real rating: 83.5/100this is my 3rd favourite film of chaplin's. modern times and the great dictator, rank higher for me personally. though to the man himself, this is his favourite film and welles, kubrick, tarkovsky and woody allen agree. it is strange though that chaplin's 3 greatest works came after he was deemed obsolete, but being the artistic luddite, he was. he pushed forward and did not allow modern technology to steal his craftsmanship. in a way, you must applaud that, but at the same time from a critical analysis standpoint, you must also detract marks for it. for is it genius? or a has-been doing their best to cling on to a world that has moved beyond them?be: with a chaplin film you have to ask yourself can you really comment on the directing. given that he does a large percentage of the workload himself, it would be like applauding michelangelo's overseeing of the sistine chapel rather than the painting itself. the editing is decent, and the transitions move swiftly and give a sense of speed and the story with what limited cinematography we have for the time.w: the writing is simple but effective. some claim that the pathos as they put it is limiting the film and not allowing it to be as good as it can be. however, we have seen the tramp 12 times prior to this, and this is the last outing. giving this comedic character a sense of compassion and sympathy at this stage is where the story should progress. rather than leaving it in the purely farcical realm. we have completeness and sadness that often appears in great comedy, and from the very first scene with the tramp and the blind girl, we have a pleasant mix of longing with pratfall comedy.c: it is 1931, and fritz arno wagner is continuing to put hollywood cinematography to shame. meanwhile, in hollywood, chaplin has brought along his old standby in roland totheroh, and he provides the standard for a chaplin outing. the angles on some shots are nice, and some of the shadow work is pleasant, but nothing outstanding.a: at the beginning of the film, it says it is in pantomime, which implies over the top acting and with subtly and nuance removed from the piece. which would be fine, save for the fact that it does have these things due to the previously mentioned pathos. which forces me to be meaner on some of the more weak acting exhibited by the rest of the crew. chaplin is excellent and very few people have such command of body language as he. the blind girl did not always feel blind, but we are still in the early days of cinema, so it is slightly excusable. s: the opening of the film is annoying in terms of sound. we have mumbled audio from several characters, and then the tramp appears and then silence. which seems to imply yes films have dialogue now but let us enjoy this nostalgic throwback. which is an excellent way of presenting the film, but in terms of audio quality, it is weak, and we could have had that same effect while presenting clear audio to the viewer. the rest is standard silent film fare.pd: the sets are sets of the era, and they took effort, but nothing stands out, especially when one knows what is coming in the 1930s in regards to set design.ba: costume design is again very hollywood and of the era. nothing makes it feel all that special save for the tramp himself.evo: thoroughly enjoying and while the comedy is not on par with the circus or modern times. it offers the viewer so much more and allows us to see how romantic films should be done. i kid you not. look at most of the great romantic movies, and you will find that the romance in the film is left in the background and only adds to the overall work. like a lovely sauce over a delicious meal. rather than your standard romantic movie which is like eating a 15 kg bag of marshmallows in a single sitting.","it is one of the greatest not only comedy,but in general,film.it is the best film of outstanding chaplin.the classic for all times.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moonlight,"there is, somehow, an interesting story here, as well as some good acting.  there are also some good scenes (particularly those involving his ""adopted"" father).  however, the cinematography and direction bear resemblance to the average home movie.  there is also a huge gap in the story between an incident that happens in high school and chiron as an adult.  what passions does chiron have other than the fact that he is gay?  what does he even do for a living as an adult?  most of these characters are stereotypes rather than well-drawn human beings.",what a terribly boring film.  i'm sorry but this is absolutely not deserving of best picture and will be forgotten quickly.  politically relevant?  yes.  entertaining and engaging cinema?  no.  nothing performances with flat faces and mistaking silence for subtlety.  it checked all the oscar boxes and got its reward but forgot a script and performances.,"i don't understand the hype behind this movie. i felt like there was going to be a good message behind it but in the end it felt very lacking in substance.  if the movie was about a straight white guy it wouldn't be getting much attention and would be seen as mediocre at best.i think the reason it got the attention is only because the subject matter was about a gay black guy. if we've had a few movies like this already nobody would be looking at this like it was something special.  i get that people might like seeing this subject matter but that doesn't excuse the fact that there's hardly any substance to it.by the end i was left feeling like i was supposed to be impacted somehow but any message that it had fell extremely flat.  again, i think if it wasn't for the subject matter most people would recognize this as a mediocre movie.","as far as academy award affirmative action handout recipients in this year's nominations, this is the other end of the spectrum from the much more watchable, commercial and accomplished ""hidden figures"".  this artsy, european and asian cinema influenced personal story is a very small low budget film of slight accomplishment. that doesn't make it less worthy though.  what does is the fact it is a far lesser effort than so many others and has no particular brilliance.  just because a story is personal does not qualify it for production nor a wide audience.  everyone has a story, and most are not cinematic enough to be told.  sorry.  yet still, there is nothing wrong with telling a little story from your life.  it's good the film was made and has its merits for some.  what is wrong is the sick deranged mass over praise by shallow crying to be noble critics for a very slow, arty for art's sake, little film that doesn't deliver on story craft or emotion to any degree remotely close to a great personal film with similar subject matter of growing up in a rough city setting like ""boyz n the hood"".  what is downright corrupt and disgraceful is the academy's biased pc/racial/sexist/diversity driven endorsement by handing this slight effort 8 nominations simply because of its black gay identity!","for me, it was realistic and well acted, but lacked any entertainment value at all.  the story was simple.  the dialogue was sparse.  there was no humor.  there was really very little drama.  i waited for something to happen, but after the first 40 min., i knew i'd be waiting until the end of the movie.  but there was no end and no real message.  i've seen hidden figures, fences, and manchester by the sea.  moonlight isn't in the same class as far as movie entertainment. i can sincerely say, i am sorry i saw it.  i am not sure why it's getting awards.",a gay movie for people who don't want to be bothered by actual gay sex.  a movie full of gay movie cliches and half-baked characterizations.  the biggest disappointment of 2016.,"this film is so real. it treats its characters with so much care and sensitivity. this is an epic recapturing of adolescent and early adult life similar to epics like boyhood and yi yi, only it's on a different level of filmmaking, because this really exemplifies laser-focused storytelling, from its beautiful cinematography to its masterful dialogue. i felt so many raw emotions watching this as chiron (the protagonist) takes each of his steps transitioning into adulthood, forming his identity with regards to race, masculinity, and sexuality. to see it all unfold the way it did made me feel lucky to be on the viewing seat instead of being in the type of environment chiron was forced to live in. this film is definitely a heavy one, but despite its rawness i think i'm still going to see it again in theaters just to appreciate all of the poignancy and detail in it in how it addresses the tougher aspects with regard to masculinity, sexuality, race, etc. overall, definitely a must-see.","this is easily the best directed, best written and best acted movie of the year.  its too bad that the subject matter isn't more appealing to a wider audience.  moonlight examines how we protect our inner being by camouflaging our exterior self.  with all the kiddy stuff these days, it is refreshing to see a great adult saga.   an academy award nominations for best picture is virtually assured.","a movie that is rated usually by it's ""social significance"", that is catered specifically to oscar wins, predictable and prosaic, it doesn't deserve to be among the best movies ever made. alas, the year is 2016 and the regressive left need a space to vent.","terrible movie, no reason to watch. it is depressing and unrealistic in many ways. unbelievable that so many critics and people here are giving this movie favorable reviews. nothing good about it. ""real"" ""sensitive"" please!!! it is some idiots idea of a realistic movie with stereotypical characters and a nonsensical plot. save your time and money.",never watch this annoying gay propaganda. this stuff too weird and boring at same time and never deserve to take oscar or any other prize.,"the most overrated film of the decade if not of the 21. century so far. a mediocre film out of a mediocre script lies between city lights and touch of evil on the list, that's unbelievable.",a story of chiron's unfulfilled desire to feel loved plays out beautifully in this gentle film set in a gritty reality of the black neighbourhoods of usa's southeast.  attention holding right up until the end.,"una muy buena historia bien hecha, con buena dirección y actuaciones sublimes.","it was an alright movie. it had it's charming scenes here and there, but over all uneventful.  it really was pretty boring and drawn out.  there is no larger punchline other than that he's gay.",putting the acting aside - this is one of the most overrated movies in the history of cinema. i'm not homophobic but the plot is just worthless. i don't think i'll ever waste my time on watching this again.,"for an accolade wining movie, this movie falls short in depicting the depth you would otherwise expect. the characters fail to be fully fleshed out to realize their potential. while the topic itself is a goldmine for exploring in the african american community, it falls painfully short of reaching out to the human element in it. the lead while growing in the movie does not grow as a character.","great cinematography. devoid of entertainment value. terrified to step up the pace. it's an extreme challenge to take dialogue away from a main character by making them quiet by nature. moonlight leans into it. little dialogue, slow pace, frustratingly dull picture.","one of the strangest movies i've seen. brokeback mountain meets the wire. but, i have to admit, it did make me think. like, was there a plot in this movie? or, how did this ever win best picture?","moonlight is a highly ambitious and extremely hyped arthouse flick. i have to say, i had to see the movie twice in theaters to really wrap my head around it. there is some amazing acting and cinematography in moonlight, and it really does stand out as an above average queer film. it's a solid first film, and i can't wait to see what the writer and director do next! my biggest complaint is the performance of naomi harris. her character is so unbelievable that it really took me out of the film. it wouldn't have bothered me so much if her character hadn't played such a big role. i can't honestly give this film higher than a 6, that's how badly it bothered me.","saw it last night.   didn't know a thing about it before walking in to the theater, except for the awards.  gripping drama about the broken homes and neglected children that contribute to the way things are.  the film didn't develop much beyond the first half , became slow and tedious.  characters didn't delevop much either.  had great potential, but didn't get there.  overated by critics.  why?","great start but none of the three chapters were long enough to get any more than a feel for the main character.  what you have is a highly impressionistic film that doesn't even attempt to get to the root causes of chiron's problems, turning out pretty much as you expect.  why all the 100s and 10s i have no idea, other than the theme beguiled reviewers who could pretty much insert whatever feelings they have on the subject into the movie.",how to win oscar with average movie: make it about black homosexual guy. one of the most overrated movies of all time,"to start and make it clear, this movie has some of the best acting ever on a film. the film itself had some big flaws, at least for my taste. the 1st & 2nd acts felt so organic, it presents situations that people may feel related to, because it was very well made and close to real life situations. once the 3rd act starts, there is a little ""situation"" involving the encounter of two characters. that ""situation"" felt too unreal, & cheap. it's something that just doesn't happen in real life, and felt forced so that these two characters meet each other. that organic feeling from the first two acts just felt destroyed by that 3rd act and made me feel disconnected & angry by a long time. therefore, i just felt very underwhelmed by that and it destroyed my experience watching the film. honestly not worthy of the oscars best film, but still worth to watch & judge by yourself.","all hype imo. i expected so much more from such a critically acclaimed film. i thought the whole adult section was a disappointment. he becomes his harden criminal and yet he is so easy to forgive his mother, a junkie who treated him like garbage, and rekindle the love he had with his friend, whom he had a one off encounter with before going to jail. it just doesn't really feel satisfying to me.also, i think it would have been more interesting seeing him in his teen/adult years. to see how he got into the world of drugs and how he became the man he is today. that would have been really interesting to see. this film has easily been the most overrated film i've seen since avatar.","i'm pretty surprised by how positive this movie has been reviewed.  many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie.  this is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie.  to start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as gay long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him gay he then turns gay. it is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. i guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. it's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. the best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie.  his sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach.  at least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie.  every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son.  not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired.  the music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. the biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled gay kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler.  in the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and i guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?  this is a story that takes place over a 20+ years of a persons life, but quite literally goes nowhere in all that time.","one of the best acted movies of the year, which unfortunately does not make up for how boring it was. i fear that we once again fallen prey to political correctness whereby you are labelled a homophobe and racist if you do not like this movie. i am neither. i just did not think it was a very good movie.","i think the reviewers only gave this film the extremely high rating it got because otherwise they would be called ""homophobic"" by the sjw community...lets be honest, though; this film is a 3/5 at its best. while it does tackle a rather difficult subject and has great performances, its really how overly simple and average the story and cinematography itself is compared to other similar films. there have been similar films such as this which go through a boy's life as they grow up in a rather messed-up part of the world/family; examples include ""city of god"", ""do the right thing"" and ""gran torino"", yet this film is nowhere close to the aura and sheer beauty of these films.","everything is so predictable in this movie that it keeps you waiting for something upsetting to happen, but it never does. the more it tries to fight against stereotypes, the more it revels in them. it certainly has its lyrical and touching moments, but it lacks honesty and character depth, and it's too abrupt in the kid-boy-adult evolution of the protagonist. reviews outside the us are far from rave.",if i open my history i can find at least 10 gay porn films featuring black couples that has a more compelling story line than this film. i watched for about 15 minutes 2 gay black dudes drink wine in a diner talking about the most boring crap you could imagine that ended up leaving me blue balled.,"aren't we all hot moths in search of light and warmth? this was the feeling this movie left me with, passing through the film reel and reaching directly over. it was just a feeling though, and it stayed with me for just a couple of seconds. everything else was not so memorable.","this film is bad.is well directed and played by the actors but the plot is just bad, badly told and mildly racist. the characters had a game where they just beat the **** out of each other.why? is just because they are black? and they are all ""stupid"".all they talk about is ""yo **** i slained dat **** they love story is just awful.this gay drug dealer that has been in prison for years because a guy got forced to break his face when he comes out just say ""oh well, haven't been gay in a while. lets go back to a guy that hit me, just bc he jerked me off 10 years ago."" 10 years. he didnt forget, he didnt fall in love with someone else. someone might say is because they love each other.no, they don't. or at least it isn't show in the film in any way. they are close friends but they talk like 3 times in the **** film. and once is just kevin (one of the two) saying ""yo **** i slained dat posseeee"".i don't know. i think this film is a scam.","i love a good drama, but this could have been condensed to about 40 minutes. yeah, the subject matter is important, the character types are not common enough, but the story itself is a snoozefest.","i didn't really like it.  but then again, i don't like being preached at.  i prefer a movie that entertains me as opposed to one trying to send a message (whether or not i agree with the message).","once again i think i fell for the hype and found myself disappointed in a movie when i actually saw it. “moonlight” is not your ordinary movie in that it tackles the subject of a gay, black 9 year old kid/teenager/adult as he goes through discovering who he is. it is not a ‘gay’ and/or ‘black’movie meant only for a minority as it gets into the many feelings all human beings go through.chiron (alex hibbart as the 9 year old, ashton sanders, the teenager and trevante rhodes as the adult) goes from being an alienated, bullied boy to a muscled drug dealer who nobody fools with and in a way has followed the path of his mentor and surrogate father, juan (mahershala ali), who taught the kid how to swim and discover himself.we also meet his friend kevin (played at the three same stages as chiron by jadin piner, jharrel jerome and andre holland), his mother (naomie harris) and juan’s girlfriend (janelle monae) who offers chiron a place to stay whenever he needs one.chiron, as many gay kids, of any color, becomes a loner, is beaten up by schoolmates and accepts whatever kindness he receives. it was interesting following his path and where it goes. the scene in the diner is a love story unto itself though nothing is said about love except for a record playing on the jukebox.the film failed me in that certain sections the jargon, vernacular, made it difficult for me to hear what was being said though i understood what was being done just as i didn’t quite understand the relationship between juan and chiron and how it became about and took the turn it did. also a few very interesting characters just disappear from the film. i wasn’t aware the n word was used so much between blacks as it is here at a certain level.all 3 actors playing chiron are outstanding as is the oldest kevin. the arch of chiron’s life holds your interest though at times moves too slowly. ali’s juan is an imposing figure and the two women, harris and monae, especially the former are strong in their portrayals. the direction and screenplay by barry jenkins, based on his life, tackles a rarely told story in the movies but it is also about loneliness and trying to answer the question “who am i?”  some scenes are held too long, others don’t finish the thoughts being expressed. there are two powerful scenes i don’t think i will forget though they may go over the heads of others.i do recommend “moonlight” but don’t go in with high expectations as i did and approach it as going to see a good film with a new story.","good, but slightly over-rated by media hype.  starts off very well and then loses steam as it goes along.  the first 45 minutes or so were great and the last 45 minutes were just ok and very slow...it was almost boring really at times.  i did like it, as i like artistic film but i certainly wouldn't call it a masterpiece as it has a number of problems, and is just a good, but not ""great"" film.","how did that movie even get nominated for a ""best picture""? it was slow, boring and nothing happened, oh and lots of the camera work will actually make you feel dizzy. was it real? yes, but who cares... nothing ever happens.","below you'll find people who say how ""real"" the film was and how empathetic it was to the social context of our times. this is the problem.not only does this movie unrealistically fantasize gay culture, it is also wets the dreams for virtue signalling critics. this movie tries hard to be so-called ""realistic"" but falls into the same predictable tropes and frameworks of usual love drama. the only oscar-worthy thing about this movie is its homosexual sprinkles to cover a repetitively overcooked cake. but this is not just any cake...this cake is chocolate brownand with the political climate of race-baiting and un-grounded claims of discrimination; its no wonder the film industry drones bow down to the masses. this movie is a pass for anyone looking for something remotely interesting. you'll get bored out of your mind with moonlights cliched characters and plot.","a well-directed and well-acted film, but if you're not african-american or gay, you might have difficulty identifying with any of the characters in this movie.","at first it was wrongly given to la la land, and truly, it should have stayed there. the oscar ceremony started cracking by all the errors committed and it is also cracking by the nomination of such movie. during watching the movie i have asked myself many times why it won the oscars. it was so boring, dull, and pointlessly slow. it was missing so much to be a good movie. getting off my seat was the best part. the actors acted very good, but the whole story is not worth it in the oscars. this won the oscars because of liberal and pc reasons.","i really didn't expect the great directing and how great it was shot, mahershala ali gives a good performance a well, but i really feel that the that a slightly better score could have made some moments more watchable as some scenes were really awkward to watch, but overall i would say a pretty decent movie","told in three parts, this story follows the life of chiron from childhood to adulthood as he struggles with both the trauma of having a drug addict mother and his own sexuality. i will always appreciate a film that shows a demographic that doesn't get much mainstream representation. it is a beautifully made film with some of the best use of colour and cinematography of any film last year. however, i felt that the technique of skipping ahead to different stages in chiron’s life while interesting meant missing out on his development and results in a lack of connection to the character and dulled the plot. i thought that the beauty of this film both in its message and aesthetic made it deserving of the best picture win although i was sure that la la land was going to take it and i was rooting for manchester by the sea or hell or high water. it's a good film. not entirely entertaining or exciting but well made and well acted.","este filme é tão real, pois trata as suas personagens com muito cuidado e sensibilidade. eu senti as emoções do chiron, que dá os seus passos para a idade adulta, formando a sua identidade (relacionando a sua raça, masculinidade e sexualidade). este filme é definitivamente pesado e, em termos gerais, um must-watch.","great direction, cinematography, and performances but the story was lacking and it really did not stick with me. well-crafted but overrated.","barry jenkins, today's hollywood's toast of the town, is really only concerned with the paint job. the showy, arty elements. the “dreamy” camerawork (or out of focus and shaky camerawork if you prefer), the poetic dialogue (laughable), the delicate background music. he doesn’t much care about the characters as people, but as parts of his little tone poem school project.","i see some good scenes, good story, but it is boring! why should i write more!","to start with the bad or the good criticism? 'baaad', okok. the movie start phlegmatic, very watery and you can't orientate much. there is one a little bit weird protagonist, which story and reasons for that silent, outsiderish essence are unclear. in my opinion - an important pass. anddd there were some unnecessary s*** in this movie, i must admit. anyway, as i said, the beginning is perceived to be slightly phlegmatic, but suprisingly you get used to it - the atmosphere and the time. the protagonist performance was brilliant, no doubt. basically, except some passes, at times confusion and the whole time too stretched story, i like it, i don't know, it was touching.","one of the worst movie of all times! boring movie, i can't understand why it won the oscar.",worst movie at all time there is no story worst character in the history and there is gay support this movie made me wanna sick,"in my opinion, another highly rated movie by critics for its subject matter rather than the quality of the movie. i found it boring and difficult to get into."

Pinocchio,"classic disney at its finest. not my favorite disney movie (reserved for fantasia), but it's a close second. the animation is lush and the story is charming. it's a wild adventure about what it means to be human and be loved. what more could you ask for? i've heard the source material is much darker, but i choose this pinnocchio.",okay young disney even though this bombed this is an improvement its funny and dark but also the problem is that the ending fells a bit to fast paced,"disney's second venture into the world of animated features is unfortunately not only rocky, but also flawed with a poor act structure. pinocchio is written to either be clever when he has to, or dumb when he has to, which then dictates where the story goes. he never has any character growth and the reward in the end thusly doesn't feel earned. jiminy while funny and a great character overall, doesn't do anything to further the plot. he's more along for the ride than anything, despite him having been tasked with being pinocchio's ""conscience"". his reward in the end is also, not well earned. several characters and plot lines go nowhere, and the overall story feels more like a verb game than anything.but this movie is not without it's good sides. it has overall excellent animation and the  movie has a thoroughly dark theme that i quite enjoyed. it might have gone overboard several times, but it never feels too dark. i would recommend it if you're interested in seeing some of disney's roots or if you're up for a dark movie, but if not you're probably better off watching something else. ""when you wish upon a star"" is a classic that will always remain in my heart","which kid does never heard about the most famous big-nosed in cinema's story? yes, this is the impact caused by this classic cartoon.","so after i reviewed snow white a huge box office success, pinocchio is the magical one. why? because when you wish upon a star, your dreams do come true. the song that jiminy cricket sings is absolutely beautiful. the characters are memorable, the songs are wonderful especially when you wish upon a star and am i the only who didn't think that this is one of disney's darkest films? i mean, there are scenes that scared the kids like the kids turned into donkeys and sent to the mining shafts and... they never come back..... as boys!the whale scene is fantastic. the chase scene is so thrilling and classy especially the death of pinocchio is kinda sad and the blue fairy brings him back to life. once again as i said it before, everybody is filled with joy. it is one of walt disney's masterpiece! and it's a must-see for people who haven't seen it but what can i say? they did! it's a movie to watch for anyone who's ever wished upon star.","i cannot tell a liethis movie was definitely released during troubling times (ww2), but considering how damn great this film is, it really shows that everyone still had the passion of filmmaking during a troubled era with this classic.","this is one of those movies that you can not miss even if it is large, many generations of children saw it and have been delighted, a disney classic full of magic, laughs, and even fear, it has everything a movie needs to children and not so children, a memory and an old instant at the time of your youth where everything was beautiful.","last night i watched pinocchio, disney's second feature-length film and in my opinion one of the studio's best features. based on the 19th century book by carlo collodi, but not half as unpleasant, pinocchio combines winning animation with great humor and excitement. there are songs, but they're never like the huge production numbers that last four minutes and feature the voice of some up-and-coming princess of pop (who'll be gone in a year) that the studio later adopted with the applicable exception of when you wish upon a star. my favorite song is ""little wooden head"" which is featured in the beginning and is a truly wonderful scene as gepetto and figaro play happily with the new puppet.the movie takes a sadistic, cruel, heartless little wooden boy (collodi's character) and turns him into an interesting, 3-dimensional kid with a good heart but who is weak-willed and doesn't always listen to reason. the animation makes brilliant use of the multiplane camera, featuring a sprawling opening sequence in which the viewer practically sees the entire village at night. the characters are colorful and fun (i especially love honest john foulfellow and his sidekick gideon) and the story has never a dull moment. this film is a reminder of the sort of efforts disney put int o their films; the man himself had a great storytelling passion that was lost in later works (alice in wonderland, 101 dalmatians). pinocchio was never as famous as some of the others, and this is unfortunate because it is his masterpiece.","the best, greatest thrilling and inspiring animated musical movie ever made! or is it the best, greatest inspiring and thrilling animated musical movie ever made? with the best movie character ever portrayed: charles judels as the voice of stromboli! plus the best movie

mucho la atención. quitando eso, la recomiendo para todos los amantes de las películas clásicas animadas.","like all other disney movies, this one really showcased their ability to animate with their drawings. its story is compelling and some scenes are even disturbing in the end. but if you want to see the true power of hand-drawn animation this one hits the spot.","people that say that this is the greatest animated movie ever made or disney's best movie aren't exaggerating, this is truly an animated masterpiece, a true work of art. the animation is fantastic even today, with outstanding character animation and a really great example of how to do it right like most disney movies, and the story, while it's obviously not original because it's based on an already existent children's story it's truly heartwarming and dark at times, with a great moral lesson both kids and adults can get something from. it captures the naiveness or innocence of a child and how important is for them and all of us to listen to our conciousness.besides the obvious dated audio quality, this movie still holds up very well from the animation to the writing, it's a movie that can still be considered a masterpiece of animation even in a thousand years more.instead of showing stupid kids movies like minions or any illumination movie to your kids, show them movies like this, movies that have tons of effort put into making a movie that all ages can get something from other than entertainment.","uma bela animação, que nos ensina muito sobre ser honesto, não mentir, buscarmos um futuro melhor e diversas outras lições. a animação é lindíssima, e nem mesmo parece que foi feita há 80 anos. mesmo com o passar do tempo, a obra não envelheceu mal, sendo totalmente reproduzível nos dias de hoje, sem muitos vestígios de preconceito ou racismo. os personagens são interessante, mas não muito carismáticos. a identidade da disney quanto a sincronia com o som já estava lá, o que é muito interessante de se ver. a ost é linda e marcante, fora toda a influencia que esse filme proporcionou para as animações futuras.porém, com o passar do tempo, as animações começaram a apresentar um foco maior no desenvolvimento emocional das crianças. as lições ensinadas aqui são valiosas, mas muito vagas. as crianças de hoje são muito complexas e exigem algo a altura. o filme é ótimo, mas quanto a isso, acabou ficando para trás.",when you wish upon a star ... when i think of disney ... this is the first movie that comes to my mind ....,"a classical entertaining masterpiece with great morals,

italian workshop of a woodworker named geppetto. jiminy watches as geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names pinocchio. before falling asleep, geppetto makes a wish on a star that pinocchio will be a real boy. during the night, a blue fairy visits the workshop and brings pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. she informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns jiminy to be his conscience.geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. however, on his way to school, pinocchio is led astray by honest john the fox and his companion, gideon the cat, who convinces him to join stromboli's puppet show, despite jiminy's objections. pinocchio becomes stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. however, when pinocchio wants to go home for the night, stromboli locks him in a birdcage. jiminy arrives to see pinocchio and is unable to free him. the blue fairy appears and asks pinocchio why he was not at school. jiminy urges pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead, he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the blue fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.meanwhile, across town, honest john and gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them money if they can find naughty little boys for him to take to pleasure island. encountering pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. on the way to pleasure island, he befriends lampwick, a delinquent boy. without rules or authority to enforce their activity, pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to jiminy's dismay. later, while trying to get home, jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to pleasure island transform into donkeys for their misbehavior and are sold to slave labor in the salt mine and circus. jiminy runs back to warn pinocchio, only to discover that lampwick has transformed into a donkey; pinocchio manages to escape the island, only with donkey ears and a tail.upon returning home, pinocchio and jiminy find the workshop vacant. they soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that geppetto had ventured out to sea to save pinocchio from pleasure island, but was swallowed by a giant whale named monstro, and is now living in his belly. determined to rescue his father, pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by jiminy. pinocchio is soon swallowed by monstro as well, where he is reunited with geppetto. pinocchio devises a scheme to make monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. the scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them and smashes their raft. pinocchio pulls geppetto to safety in a cave before monstro crashes into it. geppetto, figaro, cleo, and jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but pinocchio is shown apparently lifeless in a rockpool.back home, an inconsolable geppetto weeps over pinocchio as jiminy cricket and the pets also mourn the loss. the blue fairy, however, decides that pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and selfless. to reward him, the blue fairy resurrects pinocchio, reversing the pleasure island curse and turning him into a real boy. pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, much to everyone's joy. as everyone celebrates, jiminy steps outside to thank the fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.","pinocchio ’s story tells us:     life is a big adventure after another. there are temptations everywhere. you pursue fame, and fame becomes trapped in you; you pursue happiness, and the result is that you lose your true self.  before you go through it, you do n’t know if your choice is right or wrong; before you go on the road, you do n’t know if it ’s smooth or lost.  the brave child will eventually get lost, even though he has experienced the nightmare of life.","this comment will be italian.""pinocchio"" è un film d'animazione veramente bello, principalmente grazie a personaggi con una grande caratterizzazione e un messaggio di grande importanza per la crescita di un bambino: infatti il protagonista parte come semplice burattino, ma dopo un'avventura in grado di prendere grandi e piccini impara a usare la testa e capisce come funziona il mondo e come premio per tutto ciò che il piccolo pinocchio ha imparato la fata turchina lo ha trasformato in un bambino vero.il messaggio di questo film che ho citato poco fa è la crescita stessa del giovane e apprezzabile protagonista, in grado di far identificare i bambini per la loro età e i più grandi per la loro infanzia: tutti hanno avuto ""l'età"" di pinocchio e tutti posso rivedersi nel burattino

Some Like It Hot,fairly funny film with really good acting but men acting like women is only funny for so long.,"some people still say this is the greatest comedy ever made in hollywood. who am i to argue? even after 45 years, it's still very funny and not the least bit dated. it is one of the true classics in the history of film.i know one thing: marilyn monroe never looked hotter!the film is a wonderful combination of comedy, action, suspense and romance with great old-time gangster scenes played out first in chicago and then in miami beach. george raft and nehimiah persoff are just great as gangsters.the stars, though, are monroe, jack lemmon and tony curtis but you can also enjoy performances from famous known actors like pat o'brien and joe e. brown. the action scenes are in the beginning and end. in the middle, the bulk of the film, is the main story featuring comedy and romance. lemmon has the best lines in the film and his facial expressions alone evoke lots of laughter.this film is so famous that there is no need going into detail, but for some younger person reading this, don't worry about this being an old-fashioned, boring black-and-white film your parents or grandparents liked but you would find boring. you'll have fun watching this, too, i guarantee it.","omgosh...i am shocked how good this movie is. its 2020 and this movie is not out dated at all. the acting and writing is so good, so natural. jack lemon is halarious, so many funny scenes....tony curtis is wonderful and he was hot. the dancing scene he has with joe e brown was cracking me up i had to keep rewinding it to see it again. i hope younger generation watches this movie. its incredible. gotta say i dont love merylin monroe, she is over acting and just not believable. but who cares jack lemon is brilliant!","refresh my memory..some like it hotthe comic sequences aren't just some hocus pocus but contains some concrete material that has witty humor and amusing characters that focuses on the crisp of it and not some lame one liners or double entandre. i.a.l. diamond and billy wilder; the screen writers, adapted the raw concept smartly and projected it onto various conversations that draws out laughs; especially the ""train"" sequence. billy wilder's brilliant execution is the key that helps keeping it to the ground and practical despite of having some sketchy scenes in it. jack lemmon and tony curtis are flat out hilarious in their parallel roles and are supported thoroughly by marilyn monroe. some like it hot defines and preaches others on how to create such genre feature and that is by focusing onto its lead characters that should and does go in here the journey that is full of chaos and bold but still never leaves the fun out of it.","i watched this film at the age of 14-15, i liked it very much and wanted to watch it again and it was as nice as i remember.i think we laughed so much that almost everyone would be happy to watch this movie.jack lemmon fascinates you with his acting really he plays the role and makes us feel it was one of the best acting i've seenmy favorite and most laughing scene was the dance scene of jack lemmon and joe e.brown duo,is probably one of the best scenes in the history of cinema.would definitely recommend to everyone.wonderful movie a masterpiece.but of course there are some bad aspects of ridiculous scenes, but you don't wear them too much.","i can see the appeal of this movie, especially for its time. it is well executed and the acting is great. many of the comedic scenes are original and it is remains light throughout. however, it pains me to say i just did not find myself being immersed or laughing very often, perhaps it was too light for my taste. even comedies have a level of tension, suspense, character development, intended to pull you in, be invested at what is at stake, but i did not feel that here so much.",although not all the jokes have aged well its a funny film. i also whacked it a lot waist growing up so i'm quite attached to it. its a great film that everyone should see.,"a genuine joy to watch, can’t be missed! the vast majority of the humor is as hilarious today as it was then. jack lemmon is a treat, tony curtis was acting perfection, marlyn monroe was magical, and joe e brown delivered the greatest ending line of all time!","a great movie and one of the best comedies in history, a very heartwarming and great story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

great, interesting story, which makes you think along throughout. one of the classics and i like that it had some unpredictability to it. must watch if you are a fan of hitchcock.","on a failli y croire... pendant à peu près trois quarts d'heure : le rythme est satisfaisant, la curiosité est de mise, cary grant est à la fois élégant, cynique et opiniâtre... assez drôle aussi ! mais c'est cary grant. puis arrive le train... et le traintrain d'un film qui tout-à-coup tel un vieux tortillard n'arrive plus à grimper les côtes...ça coïncide avec l'apparition de la poupée blonde eva marie saint... et même si elle incarnait le retour de la madone en personne, elle ne peut certainement pas remplacer l'autre égérie blonde de hitchcock, pleine de grâce, grace kelly. on me dira cependant que même grace n'aurait pas pu effacer l'ennui d'un coup de baguette magique et on aura raison. mais tout de même.voici donc que le film s'époumone à tous les niveaux et pédale comme un hamster asthmatique : les dialogues deviennent aussi bêtes qu'interminables et le scénario en chute libre dévoile son vrai visage de série b, écrit à la va-comme-je-te-pousse, de plus en plus téléphoné à l'avance... même l'inquiétant personnage de l'excellent james mason ne parvient pas non plus à ressortir le film de son marasme...la fin enfonce le clou et sombre dans le burlesque hollywoodien le plus échevelé et invraisemblable... certes, la musique pleine d'entrain de bernard herrmann tente de réveiller régulièrement tout ça. une musique de bien meilleure qualité que l'ensemble du film, assurément !","cary grant gets whisked away from his everyday life as an advertising executive into a complex and secretive world of lust, action and espionage.  all created before james bond was a thing, at least on the big screen.","hitchcock's risky and briskly adventure is the apt catalyst to this complex espionage thrillernorth by northwesthitchcock's risky and briskly adventure is the apt catalyst to this complex espionage thriller. as much as simply enthralling its first half is, that follows a linear singular path collecting its plot points like a reward the film moves with ferocious pace and nail biting close calls. but the second half is the one with the real meat. its complex and at times overstuffed characters with their own agendas and schemes does work since the man behind the camera is hitchcock. he never lets the content go damp which often happens in such husky script. there is a sense of similarity in here to polanski's chinatown, starring nicholson. and similar to it, the uncertainty is the key to its success.the makers are consistently revealing cards in order to keep the audience tangled in the whirls of these flips and turns that can be difficult to swallow. it is a mature script that always chooses over leaving the room with a cutthroat message rather than an explosion. the euphoric energy of the ping pong that the writers play of who is with whom theories, with hitchcock's sharp execution it never wears off. also, there is real ruggedness in here, the characters have the range to look elegant and also pull out the most sinister deed of all.grant as the real victim proving his innocence isn't always in his a game, his performance isn't persistent in its tone. but what saves the day is both saint's performance and her character, her alluring suave nature and guns blazing unflinchingly puts her on top of the list. armed with a smart and meticulous adaptation, hitchcock takes his time, he is milking out the best from each moment. north by northwest is less hitchcock-ish than usual, and it is certainly refreshing.","while it doesn't quite reach rear window/vertigo levels of greatness, there is still plenty to be enjoyed from this one. its definitely more on the comedic side than most of hitchcock's work, including some great dialogue, a hilarious auction scene and my soft spot for unwilling protagonists. add a couple of the most thrilling and iconic sequences in cinema at the middle and end of the film respectively and i'd say its a solid 9/10.viewed 25/05/2018","ok, i'll be a hater. i didn't really care for it. i felt the story was too predictable and the pacing uneven. it was a rather boring watch for me and i had a hard time finishing it, let alone actually being interested in what i was watching.",some romance scenes can look cliche but even so hitchcock could make thriller as no one,"while it drags in the third act, ""north by northwest"" is nevertheless a tense, thrilling and exciting thriller.","another excellent film by alfred hitchcock.personally, this is not one of my favorite alfred hitchcock films, although it is one of the most acclaimed and one of the most interesting. the script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.the script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. it entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons i prefer to hardly talk about the plot). the main character, played by cary grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. it goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really cary grant who stands out here. eva marie saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. another actor that deserves a positive note is martin landau.technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director hitchcock. it is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on mount rushmore. the camera and film work is excellent and cinematography perfectly harmonizes color, light, shadow and contrast, resulting in a visually elegant film, although with the characteristics of a film of its time, of course. the soundtrack is also quite good, as are the sets and costumes.",this movie is a rollercoaster thriller. one of hitchcock's best masterpiece.,one of the hitchcock`s best

Hoop Dreams,"this is one of the best documentaries i've ever seen. it's absolutely fascinating the story and evolution of these two kids through their basketball lives in high school. it's about life pure and simple with it's twists and turns that catch you off guard, the surprises both pleasant and heartbreaking. the two aspiring basketball stars engage you like few characters you will see in any documentary. and for the filmmakers to have such dedication over these years, the highest credit and thanks to them.","this is the kind of story that inspires so many to chase a dream that is about as likely to attain as winning the lottery. it supports that narrative that sports are way more important than they actually are. if kids would only pursue education with this much tenacity, the world would be a better place. sports gets enough glory in america.",hoop dreams manages to hold in a ride worth taking and end it with so many sad moments that my heart can actually break from all these heartbreaking moments.,hoop dreams is an incredible film about following your passion and dreams and never giving up. it closely follows the story of a couple different boys who love basketball and dream of going to college and pursuing it in their future.,"the boyhood of sports documentaries. filmed over the course of the high school career of two black teenagers from poor neighborhoods in chicago, hoop dreams paints a starkly realistic picture of the high stakes of basketball and the influence the sport can have on a young black man's life. the film evolves into almost a tale of two cities, with the boys developing considerably differently as they go through high school, and the challenges they face at each. without divulging too much of the plot, both boys are invited to attend a private, suburban, mostly white high school with a legendary team history, but only one can remain. once the paths of the boys split, the divisions in class become evident as the other boy attends a mostly black inner-city high school. one is afforded opportunities and saving graces, while the other must scrape by. another reason for the film's power is the depiction of the home life of the boys, showing the hurdles that they must overcome on the homefront. ""the system"" is mentioned frequently by one of the boy's mothers, and the effects of the system can be seen clearly both on and off the basketball court. basketball is a pivotal method of understanding race and class in america, and hoop dreams explores all these themes and more with effortless grace. your heart will race during the games, whether you like basketball already, or haven't thought once about the hardwood. don't be turned off by the length of the film (nearly 3 hours), it is worth every second, and you are gripped from the moment the film begins until the epilogue credits.","it was a great movie. i learned that sexual temptations and drugs or mediocrity could potentially destroy a vocation, especially a career to the nba too. overall it was a great experience watching the movie. it really felt as if i was a part of their lives, being able to witness their story happen. also i loved how they were always depending on god and thanking him, especially in their victories and also troubles too. idk what im saying exactly this is just what i think.",arthur agee you are my hero. just the best doc ever made hands down. everything went right/wrong.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rashomon,there is no denying that it is a groundbreaking movie and i liked how the shared narratives made it tough to decide if someone was genuinely telling the truth or was just twisting the events in order to show themselves in a positive light. i don't have anything harsh or negative to really say about it. it's just a personal preference as to why i didn't rate it higher. i enjoyed it but didn't love it.,the movie shows that right and wrong and truth is a matter of perspective. one of the best of all time.,"""rashomon"" is undoubtedly one of the finest films of its time, and despite the relaxed pacing and obvious technical limitations, it still holds pretty well.it's being remembered as one of the earliest examples of ""unreliable narrator"" in cinema, but what astonished me was the poetic beauty of kurosawa's visual storytelling, with each frame being carefully constructed in their apparent simplicity. credit also goes to kazuo miyagawa's photography, made of strong contrasts of black and white that keep entangling and overlapping to suggest the ambiguity of the story.the plot is taken from akutagawa's famous short story ""in a grove"", and shows how facts can be reconstructed in dramatically different ways depending on the perspective of the eyewitnesses. kurosawa adds his own ending and moral conclusion to break free from the complete distrust in humanity suggested by akutagawa's original tale: despite the lies of history and the fallacies of human nature, we have to keep on living, be charitable, and do the best we can. in a way, it almost feels like a modern fable with human characters instead of animals.not the most entertaining thing to watch nowadays, but still a visually mesmerizing and technically inspiring film.","movie gets points for groundbreaking narrative,  stylish camerabatics, and strong performances.  but only gets a 5 overall from me because, no matter whose story you believe, all their motivations and personalities are all so wacky, it really made it hard to empathize with anyone.","absolutely striking film.this  is very important for cinema film.kurosawa`s masterpiece.if you are true cinema fan,you have to check it asap!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All About Eve,a rare classic in the history of cinema. a must watch film for all movie lovers.,"intelligent, almost intellectual with all the literary references yet very emotional, erudite and totally accessible at the same time, bursting with life while filmed almost exclusively in stuffy enclosed locations, this film is a testament to the humanistic genius of mainstream american cinema (better years of our lives, night of the hunter) when cinema was still tethered to theatre. maybe the cinematography isn't avant-garde but it doesn't count: this is acting at its finest. it's filmed theatre, and that is fantastic in itself.this movie should be watched in classrooms along the ones mentioned above.","the classic backstage broadway diva witch fest soap opera.  nastiness done to a hoot.  landmark performances by bette davis and anne baxter sell this wackiness.  and marilyn monroe shows up for a few minutes of eye candy. yay.  a little more editing and tightening of the more draggy scenes, would've boosted my rating higher","bette davis as the acclaimed theatre star, margo channing, who is befriended by the film's protagonist eve harrington, a simple devoted fan of channing, played by anne baxter.  davis and baxter turn in high quality performances in this tale of intrigue as we watch the layers of the two characters fall away throughout the film.","that happens to be your practical abnormality..all about evedespite of being termed ""all about eve"", its barely about eve and i mean it in as an undercooked character way that never reaches its destination until the last act and when it does it seems like makers jumped or skipped some beats. joseph l. mankiewicz; the screen writer and director has done some appreciative work but his sheer effort to create this character driven feature with a wafer thin script shatters the feature into bits and pieces of some good material that fails to make a definite point or even bind it all. bette davis is the actual winner in here that is supported amazingly by george sanders but unfortunately one of the lead actors anne baxter's performance is what itches all the way through. all about eve is your slow pill that is definitely effective in its own way but when it does, the question starts to beg whether all of it was worth or not.","a story about rise-to-prominence of an ambitious young woman, who happens to be an immigrant. great storytelling: the narrative is told by addison and karen and adopts a flashback. i especially admire the role that bette davis stars, who, always smoking, is so bold, charitable, humorous and sexy. some notable details: the continual change of eve's dress, which may reveal her lesbian sexuality, the indifferent scoffing expression of margo and karen in the beginning scene and the scene we know eve has been lying through her stiff shadows. the surprising yet totally sense-making end elevates this picture to another level.","the best, greatest movie ever made! with the best movie character ever portrayed: anne baxter as eve harrington! plus the best movie quote ever spoken: ""fasten your seat belts. it's going to be a bumpy night."" and the best movie score ever composed!","it has interesting for its time plot,however ,i was not really impressed by this picture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Wild Bunch,fairly entertaining and well made western with good acting and writing. quite good.,"the problem with this film is that a great deal of time is spent showing the protagonists laughing, drinking, and wenching, and riding horses here and there, and after ten or fifteen minutes of this it starts getting very old.the other problem, of course, is that the protagonists are all bad guys.  they're not antiheros.  you need to have some redeeming characteristics to qualify as an antihero.  and if you're going to carry a movie you need some redeeming characteristics. don corleone had his family ""honor.""  tommy devito made for a funny psycho.  william holden and company are all fine actors, but their characters are dry as dust and we the audience are supposed to sympathize because they're ageing out of the outlaw business and the times they are a-changing.  so never mind that they shoot up a bunch of civilians and a bunch of fellas from the us army.  never mind that they shoot up a bunch of guys from the army of mexico.  we're supposed to go along with this.  and, sorry, but i ain't buying.sure, the bad guys do a couple of things that might be described as ""nice,"" but there's nothing in the film to explain why these particular characters would do things like this, since gold and profit seem to be their only motivation.i wondered if my criticism of the film might be unfair because, after all, it was shot in 1969.  things were different then.  but then i discovered that butch cassidy and the sundance kid was also shot in 1969, and that, as i recall, was a film about bad guys too, but a far far far more successful attempt at entertainment.","“we're not gonna get rid of anybody! we're gonna stick together, just like it used to be! when you side with a man, you stay with him! and if you can't do that, you're like some animal, you're finished! *we're* finished! all of us!”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Left Foot,intense but i think i liked it. at this point just watch it so you don't feel left out. his best movie still...,"i am surprised to see less no. of reviews for such a wonderful biographical film.truly an inspirational, immensely touching tale of a patient suffering from cerebral palsy.no match for sir daniel day lewis as he gives his heart and soul for his method.","a writhing response to an imperishable question..my left foot: the story of chris brownthere are very few features that are known for its stand-out performance that has touched thousands of heart and this is one of them. the writing is compelling; even though of familiar structure that follows up the same rudimentary process that a usual biography does, but is still adaptive and exhilarating, especially when created a dramatic sequences that is not only poetic but rhymes too, to the tone of it which shows the passion and enthusiasm of the makers on telling the story. it may be short on technical aspects like sound department and editing, but surprisingly it barely factors in, as the audience finds itself in the awe of the performance, for the most of the time. jim sheridan; the screenwriter and director, is in his a game and brings out the best possible outcome in each and every frame of it. as mentioned earlier, there is no flinching on the excellence and hard work of daniel day lewis's acting skills and his love towards the craft of it. my left foot: the story of chris brown is a writhing response to an imperishable question, not asked by the strangers residing in the society but the loved ones who too are any human than us.","wonderful biographical film.truly an inspirational, immensely touching tale of a patient suffering from cerebral palsy.no match for sir daniel day lewis as he gives his heart and soul for his method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Third Man,"easily one of my all-time favorites.  i mean, orson welles isn't in a ton of this movie, yet his moments pierce into you like nothing else!","another legendary picture that i'm — mostly — regretting not seeing sooner, carol reed's ""the third man"" might be the benchmark film noir in terms of pacing and structure, with a first and second act that unfolds in a deliberate, yet engrossing manner and a relentless finale that leaves you absolutely speechless. these narrative attributes are thanks in no small part to master storyteller and novelist graham greene, who penned the film's screenplay. this is a project that takes great pride in its slow burn approach, offering up a veneer of normalcy to the viewer, but with little nuances in the dialogue, tonality and camerawork to let you know something's not quite right here. once the reveals come, though, i'll say i had a consistently pervasive smile on my face. any and every scene with orson welles is nothing short of iconic. that's not to take away from joseph cotten's commendable lead turn. it's just that, with the way the movie sets everything up involving welles character, you really can't help but leave the screening remembering every scene involving him. and, while i will admit that i personally didn't care for the score (it is admittedly good music, but i also felt it didn't really fit the tone and mood of the film overall), this is still a fantastic watch.","stylish classic noir features orson welles' most appealing performance.  post war vienna,  doesn't look pretty. a city filled with schemers and criminals, who populate its' dark alleys and sewers.  morals go out the window in this sordid environment, which is part of the movies attraction.  only drawback is the movie's deliberate pace.  but once it achieves take off speed, there is so much fun to be had.","trust or mistrust.the third manreed's impressive tricks on hiding the trump card right under your nose has old magic and familiar structure hidden in there. and even though this uncertain shady streets follows a typical cat and mouse chase, unfortunately there seems to be very little skin in the game on terms of narration. and despite of the fact that the storyline suggests the inseparable chemistry between the lead characters, there is very little romance among the antics. plummeting downwards by an immense pressure of almost overstuffed material, reed seems to be in some sort of hurry to catch up the next act. in order to do so, it achieves a ferocious pace but doesn't quite glorifies the thrills and stakes of the circumstances.the makers could have easily milked out more cinema by savoring the concept and slowing down the procedure for a better effect. nevertheless these minor complications can easily be leapt over by a gripping thriller that it maps out on screen. welles as the ultimate flip of the act, has unfortunately a one dimension side of his to portray, and yet with spooky expressive performance, he sticks the landing. cotten as the leader that we all follow, the victim, the protagonist, has fairly much wider room to factor in along with valli's love angle.no matter how thought provoking and absorbing reed's world is, it certainly is too mechanical to bubble up as a free spirit. there are too many strings tied for it to be independent of the traffic which at times holds it back; the semantics is the double edged sword, both productive and consuming. the donated blood and sweat of reed pays off for his meticulous execution that still holds up after decades. the third man is the pre-war inquisitive concept that is held by an equally opposite competitive action.","some of the greatest individual scenes in the history of film, for example, the journey of the cat across the street, the view from the ferris wheel, harry lime's fingers sticking through the rain gutter. a real masterpiece of acting, screenwriting, and cinematography.",orson welles gives a scene-stealing performance in this gorgeous looking noir mystery.,i like it very much.especially this soundtrack.film for all times! there also were great actors` perfomances and great direction,all-time classic great mystery with fantastic post-war vennia. it uses of lighting was groundbreaking at the time and is still amazing today. you can't call yourself a film-buff if you haven't seen this masterpiece,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,"dr. strangelove is very simply one of the best films ever made. it easily takes the title of best comedy film. wickedly smart and satirical, dr. strangelove still very much applies to the present day situation, 47 years later.  superbly acted, well written, and directed by the great kubrick, strangelove delivers everything you could want from a movie: humor, drama, history, and a main character with alien hand syndrome. no matter what kind of movies you like, dr. strangelove is for you.","a brilliant black comedy, one of the best ever. the performances are sublime, especially george c. scott. the direction is so on target. the writing is among the best ever. superb in every way.","peter sellers gave a great performance in all the roles he played in this movie, but george c. scott stole the show. this movie is a great glimpse into the paranoia of the cold war. it is an example of how powerful a comedy can be if done right.",a satirical masterpiece.," being only fourteen years old, most of my friends found the movie dull. i, however, found the movie to be the greatest comedy i have ever seen, easily surpassing other critically-aclaimed works of other genres (cough... the godfather). it makes a statement about the workings of our government which is as true now as it was in their time. (truer? bush.) the wit is still sharp, and the movie feels much less lethargic than other slow-moving classics (cough... the godfather). you must see it.","the greatest movie ever made. sorry godfather & citizen kane, that's just the way it has to be.","a hollywood classic, kubrick is a movie mastermind there is so many redeeming qualities in this movie. the acting was above par and there is no other movie out there that takes itself so serious but not so serious at the same time, there is a lot of comedic values in here strung over a very serious plot, it's hard to tell exactly what it is. this movie will have you in awe one second and you will laugh the next. i have never seen anything like it and i doubt i ever will again. one of my favorite movies of all time.","greatest satirical comedy film ever made, as well as the funniest death scene. **** metacritic's outrageous rule of a minimum 150 characters. kubrick is the ****","it's not just one of kubrick's best, it's one of the greatest comedies ever made. black comedy about cold war paranoia? oh come on. what else could you wan't from a film?","stanley kurbrick's brillant satire on the cold war is widely considered one of the funniest movies in cinematic history. a lone general gone mad gives the green light launching an a-bomb attack on russia, and the president now (sellers) must pull out all the stops to prevent this. this dark comedy is shot entirely in black and white with terrific production design. astutely, kubrick focuses on the actual nuclear event in itself, thus removing the issues of foreign politics. the films message simply put its this; man is not at the mercey of machines,but it in fact it's just the opposite. petter sellers is sensational playing several roles and the film has stood the test of time remaining undated.","feels like 2 movies in 1, the segments on the plane and in the air force base are largely solemn and serious, the war room however is comical and insane. but this works well as it conveys what the film is about, the lunacy of politicians and the effects of beaurocracy. dr strangelove himself only appears in the latter half of the film but god does peter sellers do a good job! in all 3 of his roles. it's a pity everyone knows the ending though because it's been done to death in popular culture (along with the famous line ""mein fuhrer! i can walk!"" one of the funniest in history. however i will say the 5 minutes before the famous segment with major kong is i think one of the best 5 minutes in cinematic history, especially with the countdown, of sorts. it is truly one of the most tense few minutes i've ever seen and the acting is brilliant! the look on their faces as they approach the target in almost too real. it deserves all of the praise it gets without doubt! peter sellers, you are one of the greats! along of course with kubrick","a film that is a true masterpiece. it has it all; comedy,suspense and a well told story. the film truly shows how silly people in goverment can be. not trying to say this is what actually happened during the cold war although i do have a suspicion. overall an unbelievable film which could never be created today because of people's longing of a happy ending."," i honestly don't get why this movie is being hyped so much. i watched it because everyone seems to be so positive about it, but this movie was so boring that i wanted to put it off halfways. it's absolutely not funny, or maybe i just don't have any humor...or maybe you're all jumping on the bandwagon. i know that there are a lot of kubrick fans out there who love everything that he has made, just because he made it! if it had been made by somebody else everyone would have disliked this movie!","what an over rated movie! i give it a 5 only because i love most of kubrick's work. if you want the real deal, without the comedy, catch sydney lumet's fail safe.",one of the most overrated movies of all time. i think i chuckled or smiled once or twice. mostly i was trying not to fall asleep.," anyone who has given this a 10 must have no taste at all, or are followers to the point of being lemmings. i own this movie, and i have never made it all the way through because it is sooooooooo boring. now now, before you go ape, i do enjoy most classic movies; but in the case of this pile, where is this ""black comedy"" everyone refers to? there is not a single funny moment in this movie. who are you people that think this is laughable at any point? the funniest thing to me is how much people force themselves to love kubrick. his movies are self important slop. let the stones fly!","this was the most disturbing movie, i have ever seen. the ending was quickly done, while some comedic elements existed, nothing to keep the movie going."," i was too confused to really like it. it didn't make sense, maybe it would to ppl who knew about the war and all that stuff back then, but i don't. i admired it alot though, and there was some very good genius moments of comedy. but like i said, maybe it would have been better and funnier to me if i knew what was so ironic, and the satirycal. its one of those films you just gotta see for yourself.",dosen't deserve it's reputation.,stanley kubrick's black comedy about cold war paranoia.peter sellars is outstanding (i'm not a big fan) although mainly for president muffley & cpt mandrake rather than strangelove himself.the rest of the cast ham it up quite well but didn't think it was as funny as a lot of people make out.,bottom line: kubrickâ,"using satire, kubrick tackles the big question of the day - would the americans and russians wipe out the human race. peter sellers steals the show by portraying no less than three of the main characters simultaneously. the last, an ex-nazi scientist, so broke up the cast and crew that kubrick had to use parts of different takes.",awesome.," if i were to recognize this film as a work of 'genius', then i would be making allusions to my own ability to identify genius, thus implying a capacity to relate to what it is to actually possess genius. it would hence be impossible for me to express my feelings on this film without seeming a bit pretentious. but is it not pretentious to fear appearing pretentious? in the end, i simply can't betray my desire to praise this film, even if it means i'm a pretentious genius. so be warned; watching this film will forever transform you into a pretentious genius (or a critic), if you are not already a member of that caste. it is that powerful. and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.",ok kubrick is a marvellous director but please do not deny sellers his just reward. he was the greatest comedy genius of all time and there will never be anybody like him again.," this was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. it's a wonderful satire of cold war politics. one will really understand how ridiculous and dangerous the child-like political antics of the u.s. and the soviet union were in that time. though almost 40 years old, the film is still relevant because it demonstrates today's government's faults. this movie makes you really think about the reality of nuclear warfare throughout the cold war, and the idiocy of modern governments.","the reason i became a kubrick fan in the first place. who else could carry off ""nucular"" war as a satirical comedy. numbr 2 on my all time favorite list, just behind casablanca.",flouridation!!!,"""like fryin' chickens in the barnyard!!"" i could strap in clockwork orange-style and watch this movie for the rest of my life."," to the reviewers who do not understand a classic satire, this film was filmed in 1962-1963 during the peak of the cold war. its a politically oriented film at the ludicrous idea of ""total thermonuclear commitment"" of nuclear arms being spewed out by the neo conservative right wing of the republican party at the time. please keep it in contexts to all the young dumbed down movie goers who don't know what good is anymore. this movie is one of the ones who truly deserves a 10/10.","this was a great movie. don't listen to lee b. werner von brauhn might have been german, but he was a great man, and led our country into the future of space exploration."," dr strangelove is the comedy version of the movie failsafe,where a churchillian typeneoconservative advisor to the defense department(sound familer?)played by walter matthue advises an all out attack on the soviet union,when a b-52 mistakenly crosses into russian airspace during a war game.kuburick refreshingly does do the left-right cliches in strangelove.the red menace was rattling sabers all over the globe in that period,from erecting the berlin wall,cuba,sotheast asia.the famous german scientists-von braun,dornberger,oberth,rudolf were always in the headlies while they ran nasa.we see the british officer protrayed hilariously by sellersas well.the president is the personification of adlai stevenson.all of this makes the film both topical,and timeless."," a brilliant movie by mr. kubrick. dr. strangelove is a genuine black comedy that was crazy for that time and crazy for ours. the movie shines because of it's authenticity and the great and versatile acting by peter sellers. the movies name is a character in the movie obviously but he doesn't come into the picture until about an hour in. dr. strangelove is a extremely smart person but at the same time a nutter. he is from germany and mistakenly calls the president "" mein fuhrer"" a couple of times and his hand would start shooting up making the nazi hand gesture or signal if you will. which did show the brilliant comedic virtues of stanley kubrick. another fabulous adaptation from a novel.","easily one the the best films of all time, and, the best comedy ever made. only kubrick could have made this film."," for those of you too young to recall or to lazy research the height of the cold war, the movie is technically very accurate (unlike fail-safe). in fact, the equivalent of ""attack plan r"" still exists today(and we're still flying the same bombers and tankers --scary). those of you who miss the bone dry humor are missing out. i used to show the scene where peter sellers is captured to my troops, to show them how americans are perceived, and i use quotes like -- ""i don't think it's fair to condemn an entire program because of a single slip up."" -- in business all the time. so, the delicious script, the fantastic camera work and lighting and the terrific characterizations make this a winner boys, the world was a different place then; you have to slip into the millieu."," this film is magnificent, somehow it is able to perfectly highlight the stupidity of mutually assured destruction, without showing pictures of ruined cities or people dying of radiation sickness. it never makes light of the situation and yet is able to remain funny, an extraordinary feat."," one of the great comedies of the 20th century. absolutely perfect cast, superb acting. regardless of what a few users have said, this movie is very funny. of course it's not sex/fart/potty humor funny, which a suspect is why charlie s, arthur d, and jj moore did not like it. if you're into clever, satirical humor. . . if you appreciate good composition and framing. . . strangelove is the movie for you. they don't make pictures like this anymore!","charlie s, please view films completely before you comment. i feel very sorry for you, and your complete lack of humour!","razor sharp. a country that can consider sarah palin, a gun-totin' loon that ""wouldn't blink"" at war with russia, as a vice-presidential candidate, really needs to revisit material like dr strangelove!",a powerful message to mankind in any era.," without a doubt *the* greatest satiric screenplay of the 20th century, only less dark than the far more disturbing and blacker comedy of silence of the lambs. to understand dr. strangelove you have to understand a cold war era when the likelihood of nuclear holocaust seemed imminent and anti-communist paranoia was still running very high. you think sarah palin is bad? the script savagely lampoons the real post-mccarthy wing-nuttery of the age, from anti-fluoridation reactionary groups like the john birch society to real nuclear war advocates speaking flippantly of maximum body counts during a full-scale nuclear war. the script roasts them all and takes a good wide swing at a few other soft spots in american society -- the use of nazi scientists (we got to the moon on the shoulders of non other than verner von braun's leadership), the anti-commie paranoia that bordered on psychosis (the mccarthy era was pretty bad), the euphemistic ""peace is our profession"" whitewash of the dod (which led us to millions of deaths in s.e. asia) and so on. strangelove takes it to the logical extreme in a sarcastic - even jugular - vein, demonstrating the inanity of anti-fluoridation paranoia via a psychotic general admitting his withholding ejaculation in defense of his precious bodily fluids. this is examined in relation to fluoridation and the various epigrammatic phrases peace on earth, preserve our essences and purity of essence also revealing to us the acronymic three-letter cipher prefix necessary to cancel the attack.","i would give it a 9.5, dr. strangelove should have appeared more in the movie. the acting is also awesome and the film have the black comedy, satirical and sometimes nonsense touch which is so difficult to find well placed in a movie nowadays.","one of the funniest movies i think i have ever seen, dr strangelove remains fresh and consistenly hilarious almost fourty years on. a must see, and definitely one of my personal faves. you must see it.","perfect casting, perfect directing, brilliant camera work, superb script. outstanding black comedy with some of the greatest scenes in cinema",freaking hilarious.," i saw the film in a theater in 1964 when i was a 17 year old high school senior. i've watched it countless times since its release on dvd, second only to ""star wars v: the empire strikes back."" dr. strangelove is, in fact, my number one movie of all time. its incandescent black comedy is unsurpassed. no aspect of the film deserves less that a 10 rating: casting, acting, directing, staging, cinematography, editing, script -- all are virtually perfect. kubrick's unflinching finale should shame many of today's film makers and cause the viewer to wonder what the appropriate response is: hopeless laughter or abject tears. because of kubrick's unmatched ability to produce period pieces that defy time, the film is as current today as it was 42 years ago. even a casual movie buff should not miss this brilliiant but perfectly accessible masterpiece."," the most brilliant black comedy ever made. features memorable performances by sellers, george c. scott, sterling hayden, and slim pickens. more classic scenes than i could count on both hands. a bizzare plot, but not as bizzare as the cold war doctrine of mutually assured destruction (mad) that it so effectively satirizes.",stanley kubrick's best film and one of my all time favs.,it may have been unbelievable at the time and i will admit that it's still entertaining but giving this movie over an 8 seems a bit much.,"you really can't rave too much about  kubric's  black comedy.  after all these years, it still resonates both comically and politically.  recently, i've been showing my ukranian girlfriend my favorite movies.  some of my selections haven't held up as well as others (i.e. national lampoon's vacation).  dr. strangelove was as fresh as the first time that i viewed it...30 years ago.  the only negative thing that i learned was that the soviet ambassador's (alexei de sadeski) russian wasn't authentic.   on the positive side, he (sadeski) realized that soviet premier dimitri kisov was drunk because kisov ordered sadeski to kill the president (in russian).  if you enjoy black comedies, then you must see this masterpiece."

Gone with the Wind,"5 for the cinematography, but that's it. even as a white guy, i could care less about a privileged white woman moping about how her future is gone because of the civil war. there's a certain amount of worship for the good ole days here and i don't care for it. it's a dark time in american history that is far better told in documentary form, exposing the brutality of the antebellum south rather than glorifying its culture. people that like this movie probably fight to keep the confederate flag in their states and those statues standing.","although it’s well-filmed, this is basically a slavery-apologist movie.hattie mcdaniel’s academy award was well-earned.","while it's quite easy to watch for a four hour film, the plot and the acting aren't exception. this film actually isn't that well rated by modern reviewers.","i hate this movie, and the people, all, i hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","one of the most racist movies i have ever witnessed in my entire lifethe new york post film critic lou lumenick has called for gone with the wind, the 1939 multi-oscar-winning epic, to no longer be screened in cinemas.“if the confederate flag is finally going to be consigned to museums as an ugly symbol of racism,” writes lumenick, “what about the beloved film offering the most iconic glimpse of that flag in american culture?”the film, which is still the most lucrative of all time when figures are adjusted for inflation, screens on 4 july in new york’s museum of modern art as part of its centenary of technicolor celebrations. “maybe that’s where this much-loved but undeniably racist artifact really belongs,” writes lumenick.adapted from margaret mitchell’s pulitzer prize-winning 1936 novel, victor fleming’s film stars vivien leigh as the daughter of a georgia plantation owner who falls for her cousin’s husband before marrying clark gable’s gambler-turned-soldier. set during the american civil war and told from the perspective of white southerners, the film has long been felt to be one of america’s finest. it took 10 gongs at the 1940 oscars, including one for hattie mcdaniel, who was the first black person to win an academy award.sign up for guardian today us edition: the day's must-reads sent directly to you read morethe book, as well as the film, says lumenick, “buys heavily into the idea that the civil war was a noble lost cause and casts yankees and yankee sympathisers as the villains”. it also, he writes, goes to “great lengths to enshrine the myth that the civil war wasn’t fought over slavery — an institution the film unabashedly romanticises”.lumenick speculates that many in the academy likely feel the same way, noting that the wizard of oz – which was defeated as best picture by gone with the wind in 1940 – received a special 75th anniversary tribute. but during the same ceremony (in which 12 years a slave was ultimately named best picture) gone with the wind was all but ignored.the critic concludes: “what does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the same things as the confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the atlanta train station just before the intermission?”","the best chemistry between actors of all time. extremely and actually amazingly well-constructed and conceived, without ever losing track of the core story – indeed, there’s almost no hope that any modern film , it’s almost pitiful – could ever hope to match the grandeur and brilliance of it, let alone reach it without seeming pretentiously overblown and just bad. still, that’s the magic of it – this film is the quintessential american classic, and that’s the way it should and will stay forever.","lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud

boring bad acting no talent. the movie need to be destroyed & forgotten. 100% worthless,"one of the best produced feature films ever made, the historical epic gone with the wind is sure to stand the test of time evermore for its technical achievements, historical significance, and most importantly its ability to give an unfiltered and unaltered look into the xenophobic and racist subconscious of american culture. no matter where you stand politically and ethically, there is no denying the continued cultural and artistic merit this film maintains. the writing, the directing, the cinematography, special effects, editing, acting, character development, and score all maintain a sense of timelessness even today--nearly 80 years after this film first premiered. the film itself is very empathetic to the confederacy and slave culture as a whole. by all means, the film seeks to glorify and romanticize one of the darkest chapters in american history. yet, the more socially progressive our society becomes the more important the film remains to be seen. not as a celebration of our racism, but as a monument to never forget how messed up our culture was and continues to be. if anything, the film becomes almost a camp satire of itself--completely unaware of just how unethical and messed up it really is. this does not diminish its cultural relevance at all, but instead solidifies its importance.slightly muted by the over-arching theme of slavery is the theme of a woman living in a society with a significant personality disorder that has gone diagnosed, and thus untreated. to many, including the society in which this story was written into as well as produced into a film, scarlet's character can be immediately perceived as nothing more than, ""the typical woman; the stereotypical woman."" she is not supposed to immediately be easy to empathize with; she is, in fact, supposed to represent the audience member that immediately does not care about history--she is the self-centered, privileged white woman in the enslaved south with only frivolous pursuits of social dominance and courtship to occupy her immediate head space and concerns. this works on many levels to really expose her character, and in turn something about the human condition as a whole: scarlet starts from the absolute top of societal privilege--she is young, beautiful, and so immensely wealthy that she literally has no concerns in the world other than the one she chooses to makeup in her own head. on top of this, you've got rhett--for all intensive purposes, the primary actual love interest of scarlet throughout the movie. the two, in fact, do belong together because have how morally corrupted the both of them are. they, if anything, represent the two most morally corrupted people in all confederate society. willing to compromise loyalties for the sake of getting ahead. then, of course, you have ashley wilkes and his wife that represent to rhett and scarlet the, ""idealistic, morally centered"" role models. however, nowadays this is the point where the satire comes in for screenings 80+ years later. everyone is a slave owner, everyone is fighting for the continued rate to use and profit from slave labor, so everyone is already damned. if anything, gone with the wind is now a great representation of how an entire culture of people can be morally corrupted from the get go, but when you're surrounded by **** the debate comes down to which person's **** smells less bad. when it comes to that final line exchange of dialogue between rhett and scarlet at the end--at one time, the audience was supposed to side solely with rhett who is now completely fed up both with himself, scarlet, and the relationship as a whole. no one is truly, ""innocent"" in this mess--but, now with the added awareness of people with personality disorders, if anyone, scarlet remains the most sympathetic character. rhett is just a piece of **** unable to get over himself for anyone but the reflection of himself he saw in his daughter. but still--no one can actually be empathized with anymore because everyone owns slaves! it's a hilarious conundrum of already being damned by birthright.","lo que el viento se llevó (1939)sinopsis:este drama épico de la guerra civil se centra en la vida de la petulante belleza sureña scarlett o'hara. desde la idílica hospitalidad de su gran plantación, la película narra su supervivencia a través de la historia trágica del sur durante la guerra civil y la reconstrucción, y sus enredados amorosos con ashley wilkes y rhett butler.opinión:me tomó tiempo disponerme a ver esta película de un solo tirón ya que está a 7 minutos de durar 4 horas y vaya que fueron 4 horas bien invertidas porque terminé fascinado, me queda más que claro por qué fue en extremo popular en aquella época siendo hasta el día de hoy, la película más taquillera de toda la historia con un estimado de $3.3 mil millones de dólares ajustados por la inflación.es una historia de amor, drama y hasta con toques de comedia narrada de forma excepcional, con personajes bien construidos, un diseño de producción y montaje impecables que en conjunto se convierten en algo épico, me puedo imaginar lo apoteosico que debe haber sido ver una película de este calibre en los cines en la época que se estrenó, es simplemente perfecta.el personaje de scarlett o'hara es una genialidad absoluta ","a life-long story of misplaced love, empty quests, and paths that always end up leading home. with overly dramatic but highly convincing acting, this film wields pristine cinematography and depth that only four hours of reel can capture.","the performances, soundtrack and cinematography are great. first half is excellent, with good character development as they try to survive the chaos of war. the second half develops them further, especially the realistic chemistry between rhett and scarlett. this half drags on and is much more dialog-focused from what i remember, but it still has some good moments. overall, while the movie's length might not be for everyone, it is still a very well made film--especially impressive considering its ambition and age. a true epic.","perfectthis is a movie that even today, is absolutely perfect from start to finish.","the best picture of all time!!! vivien leigh is so gorgeous and talend, legend.","a wonderful movie, one of the greatest masterpieces of hollywood. a glory of cinema's history and obligatory for a serious cinephile. i love the cast, soundtrack... perfect. greetings from natal, brazil!","this film is probably one of the most remarkable in the history of cinema. a film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. it won eight oscars (best picture, best editing, best art direction, best cinematography color, best screenplay, best director, best leading actress, best supporting actress - for the first time given to a black actress - and even two special statuettes for rd musgrave and william cameron menzies, for technical achievements) and was nominated for five more. directed by victor fleming and produced by david o. selznick, this film has a screenplay by sidney howard, based on a novel by margaret mitchell. the cast is headed by vivien leigh and clark gable.the story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves ashley wilkes, engaged to her cousin melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. the hardness of the american civil war destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins ​​to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of rhett butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with scarlett. following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.vivien leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent captain butler, played by gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in hollywood. in fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and leigh even criticized gable because of his bad breath. and although gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. olivia de havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted melanie, and leslie howard did great success as ashley. try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. the country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous scarlett's oath scene. one of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of max steiner's authorship, is exceptional. the main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.for all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever. for me, its also the best movie ever, despite the many other great films that followed, through the decades.","flawless, deeply moving, beautifully envisaged, spectacular and for its time, a revelation of technique and acting bravura, this now ancient movie shines through the ages like a diamond in a dark mine.  vivienne leigh, aided and abetted by a brilliant hattie mcdaniel, and despite garnering a lot of negative flack from her jealous contemporaneous peers, gives a stunning central performance; even acting gable clean off the set, as she hijacks the movie with her amazing southern belle accent and her stellar acting ability - which garnered her a well earned oscar and many other awards.easily, this epic film deserves it's top spot at the greatest movies ever made list; it really is that good. and with some superb performances and solid direction and production values, it will remain one of those truly great cinematic masterpieces. highly recommended.","absolutely the greatest film ever made. even after 80 years, vivien and clark are magnetic, the story of a strong heroine is still resonant and the relish with which the performers play their roles is something that still takes your breath away.","awsome!! like seeing for the 1st time, even though i've seen it many, many times on tv.  love it.",this would win the academy award every year for the last 50 plus years. the people that make movies now should watch this so they would learn how movies should be made.,"a true masterpiece and landmark of film. it’s a movie that everyone needs to see, everybody whether they are a film enthusiast or casual moviegoer. anyone who gives this lower than a 9 needs to be shot.",物語や演出は文句なしの出来栄えだといえる。ただし到底納得できない配役があり、興醒めした。主人公は、その性格に賛否両論のあるスカーレット・オハラだが、私は彼女を立派な女性だと思う。,"superlative movie of technicolored magnificence with great acting and all entwining the mesmerising vivienne leigh who acted all else off the screen.her stonking performance is a truly luminous landmark that elevates this movie to the immotals.the most successful movie ever made, it remains an astonishing feat of period extravaganza where direction, production values and general craftsmanship combine to create an unforgettable example of supreme cinematic brilliance!","while scarlet faces some rough times ahead in her life in the upcoming civil war, she is by far privileged... blessed with inherited wealth, fair skin, good looks, and a loyal family... she has everything in life... or so would seem.in reality, scarlet is living lesser as a human than her own slaves, who are about the only somewhat believable humans depicted on screen... for scarlet is absent of humanity, love, and all the immaterial genuine human connections that makes a life worth the struggle of living. she is doomed to forever look upon what she does not have with envy, and for what she does have, with resentment.it can certainly be said this film glosses over the harsh realities of the american south under the slave system... the times are depicted in such fervour romanticism that it becomes absurdly comical. this is a work of romantic fiction however, so it need not be historically accurate. it need not teach the audience any moral message, if anything its sheer politically incorrect attitude is a refreshing sight to behold. this feature, unintentionally amusing, makes the film even better and fits seamlessly with the kind of personalities shown on screen.the acting is truly stunningly sublime, vivien leigh portrays her character with relentless perfection... she completely encapsulates in her performance the portrait of a tireless narcissist-plagued by unrequited infatuation... acting as arguably one of the most insufferable characters of all time. i detract one star from the film only for its drawn-out length, which makes it very difficult to watch in one sitting. overall however, the film is a cinematic masterpiece, with every scene masterfully crafted into a heavenly romanticized motion-picture landscape.","i will be very brief.this film is very great,i can`t say it is the masterpiece,but this film is very important for such genre as romance.","a truly spectacular film, scarlet o'hara's arc from a nice woman to a trash person who only cares about money is truly directed and written well, you truly become invested in the love story between scarlet and rhett, though it is great, the near 4 hour runtime will definitely make people change their minds about it but an all around classic!","at least this is not a worthless moonlight, this is one of the best film from usa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days",powerful. not a happy story by any account but a story of mis-guided friendship where there is no happy ending for the 'good one'. its a dark novel brilliantly transformed to the movie screen.,"i can't remember a movie where i cared so much about what i was watching.  though it moves slowly and inconspicuously, it builds an incredible amount of momentum by the midpoint.  i found myself thinking ""please please let things work out for these two girls"", as if they were good friends of mine.  and i'm usually overly critical and not easily drawn in.  it helps that mungui manages to avoid a single false note in the entirety of the film with his direction.  anamaria marinca plays her very difficult role without a trace of self-pity.  this is a truly amazing movie that surprised me.","if this was awarded the #1 best movie, i can write off the rest of that year.  perhaps there is a lot of politics behind that award and the high ""critical acclaim"" which distorts the rating.  the movie is dark and dull.  i'd rate it lower but i like films that have historical context, foreign cultures, and are in other languages.","if it was exactly august 31st, 2007, we would have exactly 4 months, 3 weeks, and 2 days before the release of this film. exactly what a legendary film would bring us.","this movie is one of the most powerful, shocking, realistic movies i've ever seen. it also somehow pulls off the impossible task of making a well-rounded argument about abortion without getting too political. that probably sounds insane, but i swear it's true. if you are anti-abortion, you might leave this film with the belief that we need to legalize it completely. if you are pro-abortion, you will definitely find yourself second-guessing your beliefs, because this movie does revel in some gruesome imagery.the color scheme of 4 months, 3 weeks, and 2 days is stunning. the cinematography and direction is immaculate. the acting is really great, and really hard to watch. i don't know if i'll ever watch it again because its so upsetting, but i am really glad i watched it. it can be slow at times, and that's not always a good thing, but this is a must-watch movie. i'd put it up there with works like schindler's list or twelve years a slave.","tense, unexpected, interesting, good plot. because i don't speak romanian, difficult for me to know if the acting was ok or not, but it seemed good. dialogue seemed good also from the subtitles.","la historia es interesante, pero la peli es muy lenta, como todas las de artes.","in this gut-wrenching drama, we are presented with a story that will shake your core, ""4 months"" thrives on realism, it doesn't spare us anything and will not shy from displaying the gruesome world we live in, it tackles what arguably is one of the most controversial topics in modern society and it does it with an elegant polished style, the acting here was everything, the two opposite leads are just near damn perfect, the emotions and sentiments that they illustrate are breathtaking and so moving, so much so you find yourself majorly invested in what's gonna happen next. this is the brutal life-like cinema that i like. it offers a unique insight into a world so dark you can't take your eyes off it.","the neorealism and morbidity of of the subject might shy away some viewers, but everything about this movie is handled with such delicate care - the acting, the cinematography, the absence of a film score - that it really does suck you into it's existence, forcing you to feel the hardships of living in a state of oppression. moral of the story: don't live in a place where abortions are illegal.","you keep expecting something to happen, but nothing happens in this movie. the doctor makes an unusual request half way through the movie, and that is all.","watch this movie for the perfect example of how to trick everybody into thinking your movie is good, without actually having to create an intelligent story. just make it about a controversial issue, have a shocking proposal from a doctor to two women halfway through, and show a human fetus to freak people out. then everyone is so blown away that they're convinced it's because of the merits of the film. i wouldn't really call this a pro abortion movie. in fact, the fetus scene is like the videos of slaughterhouses they make to convince people to become vegetarians. regardless of the stance it takes, it doesn't really go about it in a thought provoking way. the one thing i did appreciate was the idea that the one girl was willing to accept the doctor's offer for her friend. it was an interesting statement about friendships, although it's possible that that just happened by accident, and that the writer wasn't really even thinking of that. i will not reveal my opinion on abortion, but i don't think it matters. a weak script is a weak script. the movie is all about shock value, and people mistake that for decent writing.","a pointless waste of time unless you find watching a back alley abortion in communist romania to uplifting. i'm not anti-abortion, i just found the film to be a monumental waste of time."," how did this movie get such high reviews? i love foreign, art house, film noir but i just found this incredibly boring, slow and pretty slim on plot and dialogue. i just could not figure how many of the scenes even added to the overall theme, experience or anything. but glad the people who loved it loved it."," this movie is a drag, a slow, depressing movie that is surprisingly average for the reviews it has been getting. the only reason its been rated so high is because it deals with abortion and thats a politically hot topic right now. i am a fan of these kind of subtitled foreign art movies, but 4 months is not that amazing of a movie. well made, but thats about it."," painful to no real purpose, and often ineptly made to boot, this is a long, dark slog to nowhere. sometimes the most dismal view isn't the most truthful, and this tortuous grim exercise in hopeless glum grit never gets at the humanity behind the gloom. need an antidote to this ugly film? check out the czech cinema of the '60s, dark comedies that were humanistic yet truthful."," clearly, the reason that this film has such a high score from the critics is that it is a film made to entrance, to shock,and addressed directly to the liberal self reproach of the west world, and from the users because it receives massive votes from the romanians, who are in a state that says every success outside the borders will uplift the image of our country. the film was very good technically, but if you analyze it a little bit it has nothing in stake, no ethical weight, no character deep study(mr. bebe only seems real because he talks real but his actions are completely cartoonish and unmotivated) , and the girls are so common, so devoid of any ethical sense that i struggle to care for any of them. plus, it?s more likely a short or a medium length movie, made a feature film by some pointless scenes."," this is the not just the worst movie i've ever seen, this is the worst movie ever made. this is also not hyperbole. this movie is all the proof you need that critics aren't real people, they're pompous idiots who sniff each others farts."," after having seen the rave reviews on metacritic i decided to buy this film. honestly, i'm at a loss as to what all the fuss is about! it seemed like the film never really got going, i couldn't connect with it, and, as other people have said, not a great deal happens. though not the worst film i've seen by a long-shot, disappointment was my main feeling, that and waiting for it to end..."," to see this movie sandwiched between pan's labyrinth and dr. strangelove absolutely turns my stomach. this is movie is complete rubbish. do you want to watch nothing happen for 2 hours in a communist country in the 80s? watch it. its not ""harrowing"" its not ""poignant"" it is, however, crap.","exceptional acting and as a viewer you experience the emotions of the actors but not what i would call a ""thriller"".",is this a joke! i have a 20 minute test and this film failed. i have no idea about what was going on and could actually care less. i read some of the other comments and cannot believe that realism is so compelling when it is totally boring and dull.,bill b. nailed it right on the head. story is interesting but lacks a driving plotline. i expected a lot more given all the glowing reviews on metacritic.," oh my gosh! this movie is linearly overrated, nothing in this is either thoughtful or interesting. i was clearly bored, with director and writer cristian mungiu running out of ideas once the first half hour passes. i am truly and comprimisably letdown and disappointed, this is said to be a masterpiece. and its up for the academy awards, bafta's, golden globes and many other red-carpet nominations. and i don't think this film doesn't deserve anything it is getting. 99/100!! that is negatively stunning, i had also found this film to keep on surpassing on poor storytelling, they didn't give a singly purpose or point to what is happening, and they needed to explain way more what was happening, i was confused half of the time. anyway, i fell asleep a few minutes before the credits started because this just wasn't enjoyable whatsoever, and whatever mood i am in. for me, this blows, one of the year's worst films, in the top 10 for that."," god awful. this is another independent movie that has the critics' panties all in a bunch. the reason it's terrible: nothing happens in the movie. it plods along with scenes of dialogue followed by more scenes of dialogue about the most mundane shit ever. yeah, it sucks to be living in an oppressive communist society. we get it. at least make it more interesting with a story or something. acting is decent. the scenery and props are pretty good too; it's pretty drab and depressing looking which gives it atmosphere. otherwise, a complete waste of time.","when it was over, we were glad the pain was over. but we were oh so confused how this movie received such a high rating. it was bad beyond english words (literally).","not a bad movie but by no means worthy of all it's praise. a woman gets an illegal abortion, end. yet another instance where a taboo subject matter is confused for a compelling story.","devastating movie. besides the abortion plot. it's a movie about female friendship. anamaria marinca is amazing, bravo!"," i run a boutique cinema. this movie drew my smallest crowed of 2009. it was the only one i cannot remove from my mind, and i think the fact that it hasnt won an award reveals the hypocrisy of the oscars. harrowing and mundane in the same breath. if you can get out of this film without white knuckles, you are made of strong stuff."," a powerful and great foreign drama, the cinematography in this picture is simply stunning, the acting faultless lead by the mesmarising anamaria marinca . when i know i've seen a great film is when i could watch it with no sound or subtitles and it still has an effect on my emotions and i can safely say i could with this film, the location of this film was filmed perfectly to portray what life was like in 1987 romania, those who don't find the simplicity in this film capturing must have no heart. the only reason i didn't score it a 10 was because i didn't like the ending as much as the other parts of the film. i hope foreign cinema has some more delights like this up there sleeves.","one of the ""must see movie"" of all times.","it was good, but i felt unsatisfied when it ended. i think it lacked a clear theme or message so am quite surprised to see it receiving a higher accolade than other superb foreign language films, such as the lives of others."," strong in many respects, realism, consistent tone, acting, suspense, tension etc... however, the ending represented a huge misstep. [***spoiler***] within an hour after such a late-term abortion that woman would not be sitting down at a restaurant ordering dinner. she'd be lucky if she hadn't bled to death. completely unrealistic moment to an otherwise very realistic film."," this film is bleak--and that will put off many people. but don't let it put you off. this film is a strong experience--relentless tension. admits that people make mistakes under pressure, which is difficult to watch. above all, however, the film rings true. and on the rare occasions this happens in cinema you have to confront the ideas of the film.","this is not a movie.its an experience.how can a movie be so real so grasping.........i do not envy as such but feels competitive with a person named mungiu.whole abservation of life is so deep and true.it comes from inner consciousness.i firmly can claim this to be the most brilliantly acted and directed movie i have seen and i can see in future.the minute details are hard to understand by everyone.its unforgettable and matchless.no exxagaration but the truth.i cant see anyone could have done a performance like anmaria.its not ""acting"".its performance.this film is a must see for those who see",only people that lived during that romanian/ceausescu era can understand this movie!very well done and love the overall story.a+,"well-made, but it's correct that the academy didn't give it a ""foreign language movie"" nominee !!!",a little slow at first for my taste....but it drags you in and gets pretty intense!," i was quite excited about seeing this movie, what with the fantastic reviews. and... i can't say i was disappointed, really. it had superb acting, and on the whole it was very well done. it was gripping, to the point that my friend and i were enthralled by every detail the film threw at us as we watched. the sad part is that, after all the thrills and the suspense and the drama, it didn't deliver. we wanted it to go in a hollywood direction, we wanted that i.d. at the desk to mean something, for that little mention of a phone number to lead somewhere, but it didn't. it was comical, really, how much... more wanted. in any other film, this would have been devastating, but the incredible single takes and the emotion that the viewer couldn't help but feel along with the actors made it all too good otherwise. it's a worthwhile watch, just don't go into it expecting anything near your conventional film."," this is frighteningly realistic rendition of life in the eastern bloc under communism. the awfulness of everything down to the clothes and the offensive drunk waiters make compelling viewing. easily the best film i saw last year, and i saw cargo 200!!!"," i don't really know what to say about this film really. right off the bat, you're probably wondering whether you should watch it, and yes, yes you most certainly should. the film itself is amazing, i just don't really understand why to be honest. nothing really happens in it! but the acting, the emotions it makes you feel and several all factors help pull it through. it doesn't deserve the near perfect reviews in my opinion, but it still the best film i've saw in a while.",this was easily one of the best films i saw in 2007. clearly there is something stirring in romanian cinema as '4/3/2' is another outstanding work for that country's burgeoning film scene.," brilliantly acted! you can feel the tension and the lack of edited scenes brings you into the drama. the camera doesn't even exists, you don't feel it like a movie but like a fact, a scene happening in front of you. i'm not surprised it's a rewarded film. not recommended to youngs (they can't fully understand the scale of the event or sense the minor details)."," in the end, this is an average movie, where not much (i.e. enough) happens. the story is mostly carried forward with constant and inane dialogue. a large portion of the conversations seem improvised. in the end this is a prototype of a movie that the critics love, but the average movie goer will remain ambivalent and indefferent over. nevertheless, slow pacing and historically appropriate milieu do set a realistic and touching mood."," if andrei tarkovsky made a dogma 95 movie, it might look and sound and feel like this. cinematically, this is a masterpiece of artistic discipline, the perfect marriage of form and content, the freshest thing in years, a brand-new way to get your truth twenty-four times a second, blah, blah, blah. . . .dramatically, it does the last thing you expect from an issue movie: give you an engaging, realistic central character, so you forget about political abstractions and start worrying about what will happen to her and what she's going to do. this is a time capsule movie, a voyager spacecraft movie, a great and perfect film that may all on its own redeem traditional narrative cinema for the next few years."," [***spoilers***] i appreciate ""4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days"" for its excellent craftsmanship: the artfully composed shots are worthy of a gallery exhibit; the stubborn refusal to cut away from certain scenes is brave and inspirational; and the acting (or non-acting, it was so realistic) is sublime. overall, i agree with the critics that ""4 months"" is an uncompromising work of art. but the problem i have with ""4 months"" are in the form of red herrings, and plenty of them. for example, when the brooding back-alley abortionist, mr. bebe, pleads with his mother to go back into her apartment, the tension mounts to where you think he's going to physically toss her inside. during this moment, in mr. bebe","terrifyingly grey, as everyday life in communism, and exceptionally beautiful, as otilia's friendship and unselfishness.","this is an involving and very moving film. highly recommended. to shaun b - you sound so pompus. firstly one film doesn't 'prove' anything, especially when your point of view is supposedly the evidence, and the film doesn't even reply to your silly sweeping statement about the french - the film is romanian."," i've seen it three times already and enjoy it every time. brilliant acting, image, camera work. the scenes with long moments of silence are my favorite. you can see here how powerful can be acting without saying anything.... ana maria marinca transmitted with her back at the camera things that many actors have to use face and words to do it."," ok, this movie is very good, but it's not that good. a score of 98 would lead you to believe it's one of the best films to come out in the last 10 years, and it's not (i'm just trying to manage expectations). my main problem is the ending [no spoilers], which is a little abrupt and leaves several issues unresolved.",as good a film as any i've ever seen or expect to see again.
Psycho,this review contains spoilers. i am 13 and i would rate this movie a 9 because psycho is a classic movie and it has a nice story before she gets to bates motel and when she does get there it only gets better. the movie is probably one of alfred hitchcock's best movies ever and the way anthony perkins plays norman bates is absolutely brilliant. i couldn't think of anyone better to play norman bates and the shower scene along with the music is absolutely terrifying. this is my favourite horror movie ever and the twist of this movie is in the top 5 greatest twists ever. the end of psycho where his mother's voice is playing in his head is terrifying and brilliant. i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone(by a 13 year old kid),"whoever says this movie is not perfect is lying. a masterpiece, the best horror movie of all time.","completely perfectpsycho is suspenseful, scary, and outright f*cking amazing.","this film revolves around a small roadside motel run by norman bates, a seemingly nice man who lives under the undisputed authority of his mother. directed by alfred hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplay by joseph stefano and a cast led by anthony perkins and vera miles.i don't consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. it doesn't scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. and i think that's what hitchcock wanted to achieve. he was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. the plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn't show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until norman comes in. norman bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters i've ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. it looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met. the bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (i read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. but the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). the photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and i am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.nominated for four academy awards for best art direction in film black and white, best cinematography in black and white, best direction and best supporting actress, this film didn't win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the academy also makes mistakes. but ""psycho"" doesn't need an oscar to be a tremendous success. it is, and will remain, a milestone in film history, a cult film for hitchcock lovers, for thriller lovers and for any lover of good movies. movies like this one never dies, they are art... in its purest form.","phenomenal. just utterly phenomenal. the suspense, the horror and surprisingly the examination of conscience and mentality. incredibly well-acted and directed. one of the few movies i have seen with no problems whatsoever.",probably one of the greatest movies of all time with such brilliant and innovative plans and scenes and... put together by the beautiful mind of mr.hitchcock. dont miss this for the world,"to understand the art of editing, you must study hitchcock and this film in particular. no one could take film theory seriously without studying the way george tomasini and hitch cut this movie. then you add a score from bernard herrmann and you have one of the important films in cinema history.","ojo, esta película ya son palabras mayores. podemos estar ante la mejor película de terror de la historia, o al menos esa es la sensación que me dió al acabar de verla. los giros y la maestría de cada fotograma que imprime el maestro del suspense es digno de admiración por parte de cualquier cinéfilo. si tuviera que hacer una lista de las 10 mejores de la historia (sí, mejores) probablemente esta película estaría dentro del ranking.",i watched this movie for the first time recently and this is the most borring movie ive ever seen,"directing a story so propitious with everything there's genre has in its better, it comprehensive why hitchcock was called master of thrilling.","""why she wouldn't even hurt a fly."" dude, anthony perkins is so good. so so good. so good in fact it's kinda epic. also, janet leigh has such expressive eyes, which explains why the camera is always focus on her face. at one point while watching the movie, i was reaching for my drink until a certain scene caught me off guard and froze me in place. that scene is where marion crane is waiting at the traffic light and sees her boss crossing the street, both locking eyes. it is more effective if you watch it yourself.why do i have a feeling alfred hitchcock was a serial killer in a past life.","i think this is one of my favorite hitchcock movies. even though i saw it just recently (i know, i don't know how i have been living without seeing it either) and i knew many of the scenes before so it was a bit spoiled for be beforehand, i still enjoyed it and the suspense felt oh so real, even though this movie is made more than 50 years ago. i think this is the masterpiece in sense how you can build up the suspense. definitely worth a watch.","surely hitch took his time to introduce the main character here.""psycho"" has been quoted, remade, and parodied so many times that it lost a lot of its punch, but is still an entertaining film to watch. historical value aside, the first half is a superb example of fine storytelling, and anthony perkins's performance is so natural that it makes me shiver every time. i like how the film makes such a big deal about marion and the 40,000 dollars only to completely shift the focus halfway through. the second half gets kind of spoiled by vera miles' stiff performance but also offers an interesting twist. nothing exceptional in 2020, but at that time it must have been something groundbreaking, as hitchcock had to hire simon oakland just to explain the film at the end.","psycho is a chilling psychological horror that will disturb you long after you first initially watch it. there is a reason it is such a classic. it has a unique and surprising story that slowly unfolds, keeping you in mystery wondering what the truth is. it is backed up by great performances and music that truly make this one of the best movies ever made.","welcome to bates motel, the only in wide world with room service direct to the shower courtesy of lone, meek owner norman bates. here is where hitchcock developed a turning pint for suspense genre. without psycho maybe would not exist halloween. a must to see before you die.","i just realized on this viewing that you can see norman turn into his mother on screen.  when he is peeping on janet he gets shamed and becomes her, his mother is his shame.  janet also was absolutely amazing, her being jamie curtis' mom makes it 2 generations of scream queen headlining. the only difference is by the 70s it had become ok for the girl to be the dominant factor.  my favorite shot in the movie is the first time he sits there sipping tea like an old lady, getting worked up to kill.  also, the mom is a liar, she pinned it all on  norman, he got a raw deal.","based in the book psycho, from robert bloch. a woman, marion crane, that have a regular life with a hidden boyfriend. in one day, at her job, she steals a large amount of money and decides to run away into a new life. so she got out of the city and during her travel, ended up at the bates motel in a rainy night, when she got attended by norman bates, a young boy that apparentely lives with his mother and is very sympathethic. directed by alfred hitchcock and written by joseph stefano.the storytelling and the atmosphere in here are everything. the whole set up of this film is really great, since the very begining you just got that some characters really like eachother justifying some actions that are way more ahead in the film, and that works, the dialogues works and the chemistry works for you to believe that sam would go after marion in that motel. the whole sequence from marion stealing that money and reaching to the motel is amazing, it is tense, you can feel the burden with her, she not knowing exactly what to do and being tense of each little thing that can happen. that creepy cop that shows up while she is sleeping is another very tense aspect, he keeps staring to her and making questions and neither you or her know if he knows that she have stolen the money or if he is trying to help or do something bad, after he starts to stalk her and watch her from far away things got even more creepy. the fact that when she arrives at the bates motel she is still worried about the money, trying to solve her problems and to accept somethings while we all know that there is something bigger wrong, is really well done. that whole sequence since when she arrives there we can see the atmosphere, the place, how detailed the dialogues are to make we understand the characters and to get into the situation. the giant plot twist, for nowdays i found it very predictable, like, we never get a clear shot of his mother's face, never seeing them moving together, but the fact is that for 1960, it was probably a big hit, at that time people probably got really surprised, so as they killing the apparent protagonist in the middle of the film, so there is some really different things for that time that are great. the turning point of the story from the marion character, after her death, to focus more in norman, the turning feels really nice and not forced.the acting is one giant good point for this film. anthony perkins is crazy in here, he does have so many layers that consists in his character that it is really great, he is first very cozy and welcoming, you not sure if he is just trying to be ok with the guests or if he wants some company because he is lonely. during on his conversations we can notice that somethings get him pumped, some principle of rage and insecurity, but small and going each by each you can totally tell that the guy is mad. during the very end with that monologue, the way that he reacts to what is being said and the way that he looks to the camera at the end is for sure one of the creepiest scenes in cinema history, that look and that smile starring right at you, that is really remarkable. janet leigh also did a really nice job, before the motel parts, you can totally see that she is distressed and not sure on what to do, her minimal details during dialogues with norman really did evolve some moments. vera miles and john gavin did a very nice duo, i bought that they really cared about marion enough to do what they did. martin balsam is also really nice, he works like a fine noir detective with intriguing dialogues, going for the details in what people say.the cinematography in this movie is great. first the great decision to put this film in black and white, it totally makes sense on creating the atmosphere for this film, investigation and thriller moments work perfectly with this, the way you see the castle from down seeing it with the rain and lights on with shadows, that all was so well done. there camera positions and moviments that are realy very nice and it all helps to make the film more immersive. the soundtrack is amazing, the composition by bernard herrmann is really intriguin and scary as hell, it is the perfect kind of slasher music, wich, i'm sure, inspired some other great tracks in future.the film does have a nice dialogue from a psychiatrist about double personalities, how that work and what is happening in the mind of the person, that whole monologue was really intriguing and some good learns came from there.this is a very paranoic film, with a very nice narrative that will really out you in some thriller moments, very nice noir investigative and atmosphere situations, and a very memorable character.","classic does not always mean great. in this case, psycho has stood the test of time to be one of the most gripping and chilling films ever made.",is a classic of the excellent director hithcock with a sensational plot twist.,"eerie, mysterious, exciting, captivating,

strong disagreement with this doesn't stem from some deep-rooted desire to be contrarian.",psycho is a timeless classic and it will always be a timeless classic. this is the movie that started the slasher genre.,this film isn't a slasher film. it's the best horror movie i have ever seen. nothing can top this. the real horror in this movie is left in our imagination. that's some real horror!,i am 13 and i would rate this movie a 9 because psycho is a classic movie and it has a nice story before she gets to bates motel and when she does get there it only gets better. the movie is probably one of alfred hitchcock's best movies ever and the way anthony perkins plays norman bates is absolutely brilliant. i couldn't think of anyone better to play norman bates and the shower scene along with the music is absolutely terrifying. this is my favourite horror movie ever and the twist of this movie is in the top 5 greatest twists ever. the end of psycho where his mother's voice is playing in his head is terrifying and brilliant. i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone(by a 13 year old kid),my score 100metascore / user score 97 / 94tomatometer / audience score 97 / 94imdb 85(94.5),"in what is arguably hitchcock's finest film, creepy and unsettling ""psycho"", audiences are greeted by timelessly brilliant performances, amazing visual direction and an unforgettable villain.","psycho was directed by alfred hitchcock and was released on june 16th 1960. it was such an iconic scene which made hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. it wasn’t just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. we always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.  it was about a phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. hitchcock’s studio, paramount pictures, wasn’t sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. the movie was in black and white. they even built a bates motel mansion at universal. psycho was hitchcock’s best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like rear window (1954), vertigo (1958) and the birds (1963).  all of those were one of hitchcock’s greatest works. hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film. “you must see psycho from the very beginning. therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. we say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the president of the united states, or the queen of england (god bless her)!""    -alfred hitchcock- they were really strict and lucky for me, i’m not a person from the 60s so i can watch whenever i want.  the performances were excellent and i mostly like anthony perkin’s role of norman bates. perkins was good-looking and that’s exactly how hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. they would think about him. bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn’t bates maybe? he could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn’t know. the way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when marion crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. she was naked and her things were in there. i knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. what a genius! the story was told in a unique way. even though the movie didn’t have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. it’s also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. that way would make psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that. psycho was really influential, the greatest work of alfred hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it’s still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. it’s also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. i would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.","absolutamente marcante!o suspense construído aqui é uma obra de arte. temos os atores que desempenham um papel fantástico aqui. o roteiro de joseph stefano não deixa lacunas e dá um ótimo alicerce para a consistência dos mesmos. os diálogos são interessantíssimos e revelam muita coisa. somos convidados pelo hitchcock a investigar e entendermos furos propositais da trama.a ost é lendária, e sem ela o filme não seria o mesmo, e disso não há duvidas. a fotografia também é muito bem trabalhada, junto com a cenografia do hotel, junto a casa.e eu não posso deixar de mencionar: mesmo sabendo da morte da ""protagonista"", e também que havia um plot twist no final, isso não atrapalhou minha experiencia. poderia ter sido mais impactante sim, mas eu ainda amei.por fim, só não dou 10 por conta de uma das cenas finais, onde há basicamente um monologo onde toda trama é explicada. eu, particularmente, não acho que seja necessário. e inclusive acredito que o mosteiro saudável é um ótimo fator para que a trama fique na sua cabeça por mais tempo, ou que seja mais atraente de se assistir o filme novamente.","okay... simply watch this movie, is worth it.

done. the plot was different and had a lot of surprises at the end. the climax was really unpredictable. movie had a lot of iconic scenes like shower scene and bate smiling climax. the direction could

American Graffiti,one of my favorites ever. all that happens on that day changes everyone's life. each and every single scene is important. everything beautifully portrayed. cute carol already stole my heart. no pedo. i'm also 15.,"i think this should be higher on the list, given it launched more than a few big careers and a long-running tv show. it's modern american cinema at its finest and a showcase for one of its greats. it's far better cinema than anything hitchcock ever did, though he holds the most spots in the top 10 here.","also ich weiß echt nicht, was die leute alle an diesem film finden. magsein, daß es einfach nicht meine art film ist, aber ich habe dasgefühl, der streifen lebt vor allem von der sentimentalität derzuschauer.die quintessenz, die ich persönlich aus diesem film ziehe ist: typensind alles trottel und die weiber alles schlampen und zwar schon mit 16oder 17.nun könnte man annehmen, daß das eigentlich schon genug raum für einestory bietet, diese ist aber eigentlich kaum vorhanden. der film ist soöde wie sonst nix. ich kann mich durchaus für filme des new hollywoodbegeistern, aber der hier zündet bei mir kein stück. story öde,schauspieler blaß... nix für mich.","lucas doesn't disappoint, for a guy who is famous for his location shots, he is just driving in one car, a good old car.american graffitigeorge lucas is a formidable filmmaker. especially the randomness of his vision. the singularity that cannot be unmasked in the traffic of the ideas bombarded by him over his career. and as one does, as any filmmaker would do, he dives in on genre with utmost honesty and no bars holding him back. this film that reminds me of richard linklater's dazed and confused and everybody wants some is a testimonial to what i think was the start off for the coming-of-genre. at least, in a more successful way. and even though it might not have set a trend for the other filmmakers, the unique elements driving this one long adventurous night is not the elements but their elaborative narrative structure.for instance if looked at the type of the film he has made, the sketch scenes are the bane of its existence. good or bad, that is what we will get, have and deserve for consenting on driving along with these eccentric fellows. but as mentioned it is not enacted elaborative nature of the sketch but the meticulous branches it embraces. those deep character peaks that broadens you mind and widens the theme giving the opportunity to let the makers gloat and enjoy what they have earned.and it has to be earned. celebration doesn't come through its dutiful or necessary obligations but a well earned prophecy that it had already proclaimed in all its conscious behavior. now drunk and completely full, the film has to just fire the repercussions that these characters had been inadvertently causing both to them and the environment they find palpable. the result is george lucas's american graffiti smartly and ambitiously pulling off a long sitcom special show or a finale, with a warm, sensible and a happy ending, just as the saturday family matinee shows used to, in those days.",don't hate me but i really dont see what the big deal is.  some good parts but also a whole lot of boring.,"this is definitely one of the most influential of all coming-of-age films. i assume that this movie has established a new narrative style, and has proved that nostalgic films are not necessarily made for the sake of nostalgia, for it captures the zeitgeist of the 1960s america instead of mimicking it. a notable example of the influence of american graffiti is richard linklater's dazed and confused. and while i wasn't as engaged and invested in the characters of the former as i was with of the latter, american graffiti admittedly is the more mature and thought-provoking of the two. the characters here have some depth you would probably never see in slice-of-life movies. and this comes from the sharp dialogue that fleshed out the characters throughout the movie's running time in a very subtle way.some characters have better and more well-developed arcs than the others. they all are relatable, somewhat likable, and played by very good actors who did their best in their roles; but some character arcs feel as if they aren't fully-developed and lack some pieces in the middle. ron howard's character, steve is a case in point; although i was quite invested in his character by the end of the movie.this leads us to my second issue with this movie, which i mentioned above. it's that the movie took me a little while to get into its characters and whole the story in general. i think the reason of this problem is that the movie promised me from its very beginning that it would focus on the characters' story-lines to flesh them out; not their journeys. don't get me wrong, i adore slice-of-life and road movies, and i also knew that american graffiti is this kind of a movie. but i guess the first minutes would a bit misleading, and therefore it took me sometime for the movie to draw me in.i can't praise the movie's soundtrack enough! i mean, it's absolutely one of the greatest film soundtracks ever! the movie wouldn't have been so nostalgic, if it wasn't for its killer soundtrack. it is a key factor in capturing the era's spirit, and also in giving the movie its distinctive bitter-sweet vibe. i think i won't stop listening to it for a long time!american graffiti is also a proof that george lucas is a great director as he is a great writer. i know that the dialogue is one of the film's best merits; but man, the camera work is so exquisite, and the color-grading is superb and quite expressive. the movie also has some brilliant moments of scene-blocking that, once again, gave the movie its evocative atmosphere.(8/10)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dumbo,"after the disppointing failure of fantasia, dumbo hit the big screen. when i was kid i love it, as an adult i still love it. the opening tune sounds catchy, the songs wooing their way on everybody's heads, the animation just like the others is well drawn and my favorite character is got to be the crows. well yeah, i know people think they're racist but there only in the movie for about 10 minutes but they're still funny and also i like the clowns as well. there's a scene where dumbo's mother goes crazy because the kids are mocking her son dumbo so the ringmaster has to tie her down and lock her in the cage which is a classic scene. and also the pink elephants scene is so crazy and so dreamy for some reason, it is only when people are drinking too much alcohol. and the end scene is just absolutely phenomenal if i do say so myself.","dumbo is an animated masterpiece. it's only 64 minutes long and it never feels too short, surprisingly. the animation is fantastic, i particularly like the pink elephants scene where the animation gets really mindblowing and surrealist making it to this date, one of the most unique animated sequences in any disney movie and maybe in any animated movie ever.the story is one of the best and most touching and heartwarming in any disney movie and even in any animated movie ever, sure, this isn't an original screenplay, but still manages to be absolutely fantastic, you'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll be amazed by the animation, this movie has everything to be a near-perfect animated movie.not my favorite disney movie ever, but it has my favorite disney song ever: baby mine. why is it my favorite? simply because there's nothing better than the love of a mother, seriously, i can't listen to this song without crying, the lyrics and the bittersweet tone make the scene where it is played one of the best scenes in animation history, at least for me.this is seriously a work of art and is one of the few animated movies that get near perfection. every movie ever has a ""but"", some minor, some major, in this case the only thing that keeps this from being the perfect animated movie, is the weak character development, besides dumbo, pretty much every other character feels more of a plot device, but that's the only issue i see from this.","hijo del corazón, deja ya de llorar, junto a ti yo voy a estar y nunca mas te han de hacer mal.",i know this saved the company from chapter 9 bankruptcy but its too confusing and too weird dont get me started on  the pink elephants but it dose have its golden moments like baby mine and dumbo saving a clown from a fire pretty meh,a timeless classic with a lot of social problems hidden between the subcontext of the movie. if you look close enough you'll see it.,a decent disney film with some touching moments though overall pretty meagre.,"dumbo is one of the cutiest protagonist ever. even nowadays, each lesson film passes is relevant.","very sadthough it has a happy end, that first half really pulls your emotions.","la única película que le he dado un 10. mi favorita personal. la historia que ya es de por si emotiva, es muy triste. uno se mete en el papel de dumbo, queriendo ser alguien para tener a su madre de vuelta. la personalidad de los personajes es única y un diseño muy cute. en cuanto a narrativa no tiene ni un solo error. gráficamente para el 1941 se ve... espectacular... demasiado! se ve bien incluso hoy en día! también la música esta bastante bien! una película perfecta en todos los apartados en mi opinión.","невероятноя, сказочная, детская сказка. сюжет заставляет переживать и сочувствовать героям. скучать точно не придётся. рекомендую всем посмотреть этот фильм и может потом посмотреть ремейк 2019 года.",impresionante. siempre un clasico de clasicos. no hay forma de describir todas las emociones que senti de niño al ver esta pelicula,dumbo is a holy gem that forever reminds us of a mother’s love for her child!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Roma,"baffled by the positive reviews. this was one of the most boring films i've ever seen! the main character shows almost no emotion throughout the movie. in one scene where she is rejected you think she'll finally show some emotion but the camera does not show her reaction! unbelievably tedious and boring and i kept wanting the movie to end, as i'll never get back the time i wasted watching it.","the best film i've seen this year, last year, probably the year before that, and probably next year too. the kind of masterpiece most auteur filmmakers have seemingly forgot how to make these days. incredibly powerful and dramatic. nostalgic without being overly sentimental. just as stunning on a technical level as gravity was, without being nearly as showy. simply flawless.","i am shocked at the reviews of this thing called roma.  first off, i have no idea what roma actually is.  is roma a person?  a place?  a terrible film?  all of the above?  this moving photograph will mean nothing to anyone other than a critic looking for a high brow concept with a low brow delivery.  all i came away from the screening of this thing was #maidslivesmatter and... so what.  the flimsy story is constructed around beautiful images, that more rightful belong in a photo album and not on a movie screen.  i was appalled at the lack of reality in the substance of the characters.  also, i do not believe that the ending is in any way plausible.  the character who was the weakest suddenly becomes superhuman and stronger than a riptide.  i call bollocks.  any one who isn't trying to blow something up someones somewhere, will not like this movie, and that is most everyone.","everyone has mad respect for alfonso cuaron, for good reason ... and i think that's part of the critics' love for this film. it is his very personal, touching memoir of his own childhood, filled with evocative details and oh-so-arty in black and white. i enjoyed the slice-of-life aspect of it, but was distracted by the fact that the lead actress can't act. at all. it's a completely wooden performance, and it really stretches credulity that she was nominated for an oscar!","aside from the photography that looks great, there are a lot of issues within this movie, the passing, the plot, is pretentious and unfocused. on the other hand, there are certain things that seem 'empowering' but they are the other way around, sure it depicts a lot of issues like racism and social classes which is ok but my problem is that by the end of the movie it kind of have a racist and social message within itself, i don't think that it was intentional but is there. if you don't mind that, i hope you are prepared to lose like 2 hours of your time.","i fail to see why ""roma"" is getting all the raves and awards it has been getting. in many ways, it reminded me of films from the 1950s and 1960s from european directors, mainly italian, such as ""bitter rice"", ""the bicycle thief"", ""open city"", michelangelo antonioni, robert rossellini and victoria de sica. the main differences are that these films and directors didn't take 2+ hours to tell their stories or linger too long even by a second on a scene whether it be a boy looking out a car window or a dog jumping up against a gate. they brought new cinematography to the screen and more depth to their stories.maybe it has been a long time since critics/people have seen such films that reflect life between the classes or maybe ""downton abbey"" has given them a false picture of the same. there are little passions or emotions shown by the director/screenwriter alfonso cuaron.the surprising aspect of ""roma"" is the acting debut of yalitza aparicio as a maid who has a warm connection to the children of her employers and though she is a presence throughout the film it only comes alive when it concentrates on her trials and tribulations.with the exception of maybe 15 minutes, i was bored during most of the 2-hour 18-minute  ""roma"".","despite the good  directing and the good acting (not amazing !) the movie is very poor when it came to the plot, there was almost no story ! the film just show the normal life of any above midlevel family and their daily routine life, waking up kids for school, absent father and little brothers  fight  ! i can’t believe that such a movie can be nominated to any kind of trophies.","roma is quite underwhelming. its not for everyone, those in the comments below who raves about this movie probably saw something in it that i couldn't see. if we are going sentimental, there are better movies out there that portrays that emotion. this one doesn't seem to give it enough... impact. it could be the black and white scheme it went for, it could be something else. just my opinion. im don't watch many of these types of films, but some that i do watch has etched an impression on me. this doesn't seem to have.﻿ good cinematography but bland protagonist and a story ive definitely seen or heard before a hundred times.","i guess it depends why you go to the movies. i like movies that have a story. apparently critics and the self-important art-house crowd only care how a film is shot. i even read one review that called it a ""masterpiece"" but also said it had ""not much of a story."" another, which was one of the lower rated, said something to the effect of ""no one would care about this as much if it was done by another director."" i shrugged my shoulders after the credits came on and will likely never independently think of this film again.","bored af. boring,boring,boring and boring. there's raelly nothing going on. only one scene in this movie is worth watching. one!and it's 135 minutes long!","i'm mexican i know all the movie talks about and all the places, and as much as i tried to like the movie it just doesn't. one thing good about this movie tho; the photography, really beautiful shot.now.... the actual history behind the movie is predictable, boring and poorly written. i never got to connect with any character, thanks to a very lack of emotions from them they are just cast into a one dimensional role, and they never get out of it. if he tried to portrait the maid as they are in mexico (i mean very submissive and so desperate that they accept any circumstances) then all the other characters should have a large array of emotions so there's contrast. but there's just no contrast they're all superficial stereotype persons.a lot of scenes could  have also been removed and we could have ended up with a much shorter and less tedious movie instead we have a very long, predictable with a lot of useless scenes movie, might it repeat again there are some beautiful shots tho. i hope it doesn't get the oscar because there are just so many better narrated and well shot movies out there.i will end my review doing this comparison;roma is like a picture of some delicious food that you see it and it looks just so good, but then cut the picture and realize it was nothing but emptiness and regret to ever tried","the technical and visual aspects are just impeccable. nothing bad to say about that at all.but and the story...?any mexican people could tell me that this was the story of any mexican soup opera and i would believe it with absolute certainty and that's devastatingly alarming coming from alfonso cuarón.i'm not really disappointed because my expectations about this film were not into that side, but to call this film a masterpiece, is simply a scandal.","another black and white? can someone explain reasons? some scenes are just there just to prove the director is an intellectual! however the birth scenes was a success, in contrast to the rest that feels excessively orchestrated!","my wife and i see a lot of movies every year -- over 100.  usually the critics are helpful in finding the good ones.  they blew it on this one.  collectively!  some good photography, but usually not interesting material.  no character insights.  a waste of time.","using tabus to overwhelm human emotions into getting you a critical acclaim is a cheap way of making movies. i hate everything about movies like this. it's a masterpiece from the point of cinematography , but the story and its elements are straight up disgusting and unacceptable because all they meant to do to stir up the very core of your soul with sadness and empathy. some might get off on this. i personally think movies like these should not exist, or only exist for those who seek them. solid 0 in my book","roma deals with a lot of filler, such as characters doing these repetitive mundane tasks, and a painfully unoriginal plot that strikes almost every cliche possible: a young woman who recently broke up with her lover, an older woman dealing with marriage issues and then the children dealing with their parents having problems. and all of this just so happens to take place in the same household. it's something i've seen hundreds of times before and it makes for a rather uninteresting watch, which is made even worse by all the nonsense filler. roma is a typical oscar-bait film, plain and simple.",artsy movie that gets critics all fired up. in reality roma is a hollow and booring movie.,"una película que dividió opiniones en todos lados. algunos la consideran una obra de arte, otros la clasifican como un intento de ser una película intelectual, cuando indudablemente no lo es.yo soy del tipo de personas que gusta de ir al cine y ver una historia en la pantalla. como se desenvuelve y como llega a un clímax y a una conclusión.no soy para nada un experto en cine, ni mucho menos. ni tampoco soy amante de derbez u omar chaparro, como muchos de los simpatizantes de cuarón gustan etiquetar a los que no piensan igual que ellos.hablando objetivamente, la película tiene una fotografía increíble, como todas las películas de cuarón (obviamente este es su fuerte, no la trama. como ejemplo, tenemos gravity).yalitza como cleo hizo un buen trabajo considerando que no es una actriz.pero de ahí en mas creo que intenta demasiado ser una película ""inteligente"" de ""arte"" con su filtro en blanco y negro que no agrega nada. en fin. cuarón una ves mas demuestra que su fuerte solamente es en lo visual, en lo que a historia respecta es aburrida y nada especial. no por nada la mejor película de cuarón es harry potter 3, porque tuvo un gran material para trabajar.","“roma” is a film written and directed by alfonso cuaron and is his attempt to pay homage and acknowledge his childhood in the roma section of mexico city as well as the housekeepers that cared for him and his siblings. filmed in black and white this film has become the choice of so many critics and award entities so i find myself again at odds with the so called pros for this film, as good as it is, is not great, nor in my opinion is it worthy of the accolades being heaped upon it. this is the story of a family, a marriage and those who kept house for them…..and that is where it all really begins and ends.so, like a fly on a wall, we watch the residents and servants interact in a really not too exciting series of mundane events as they go about their assigned chores and fulfill their designated roles. i give the film a 6 rating as i continue to wonder what the excitement regarding it is all about..perhaps the highest award should go to the distributor’s pr firm for being able to generate such unwarranted hype and activity..","nothing short of groundbreaking! quality cinema. and no wonder it’s taken every award for best cinematography - so many beautiful shots, from the smashed mug on the floor to waves on the beach, to cleo literally brushing up dog ****great acting, a good pacing, that can sometimes feel like a slow-burn but it all just comes together!now, my removal of 3 points may bare unpopular opinion, but i honestly felt like not a lot happened. it was a great film, with a pensive portrayal of the life of a beloved maid in 70s mexico. definitely one of the best films i’ve seen in ages, but i couldn’t tell what the climax was - the baby arriving or the kids drowning. while not every film needs a “climax” to sum up a great story, i just felt this was a slightly less enjoyable watch than a star is born or even the favorite. roma is a film with a meticulously curated series of shots that cleverly cover a thin story. a film which the critics love but the audience may struggle to enjoy. i enjoyed it... it can take every best cinematography award, it’s unmatched this year, but best picture? not too sure.","ok, i'll say it -- when it comes to this film, the emperor is indeed naked. i'll admit that the film's stunning black-and-white cinematography is exquisite and that the scenes introducing the picture's final act are emotionally mesmerizing (or maybe it's just that i was glad that something interesting was finally happening on the screen). unfortunately, those are about the only redeeming qualities this release has to offer. the rest is a big, bloated, underdeveloped bore that tries the patience of even the most tolerant cinephile. it's obvious this was a heartfelt project for director alfonso cuaron, and his personal passion is written all over it. but, given that he's dealing with uninteresting characters in largely unexplained circumstances in a time frame for which little to no context or back story is provided, he's not giving the audience much to work with other than a glib implication that essentially says ""this is authentic -- just trust me on this."" also, the picture's anemic attempts at incorporating philosophical and metaphysical themes show the filmmaker's got some brushing up to do in terms of effectively conveying his meaning in a comprehensible way. if you're willing to risk the time watching this, be sure to pack a pillow and a lunch.","every now and then a movie comes along that reviewers who want to appear sophisticated and ""in the know"" feel compelled to heap all kinds of praise upon. this is one of those movies. boring, slow, tedious, and lame don't begin to describe it. hate is a strong word, but it is the only appropriate one to describe my feeling towards this waste of film. i honestly don't see how any real human being could like or enjoy this movie, and i suspect that very few actually did, despite their phony reviews.","critics fall over themselves for another slick foamy soapy film from cuaron, with very simple cinematographic tricks. it is obviously copying zerkalo (the mirror) by tarkovsky but with far less ingenuity, creativity and poetry. whereas tarkovsky makes his life and his memories interesting by cleverly destroying time and space, blurring the lines between reality and dream, and making us think, think, think about our own memories, cuaron serves a linear, egotistical, boring diaporama of his own life that didn't touch me at all. all this of course with a heavy dose of sentimentality and ""humanism"" that can't go wrong with middle-class critics.but what about the cinematography?the initial slow constant circular movement of the camera is obviously designed to clash with the perpetual zig-zagging of the little bee worker, create this extra tension and the rest is just like that. the scene of the fire is completely in line with his work in ""children of men"" with camera shifting from different points of foci in the same frame. all this is probably well crafted, and different from hollywood, but doesn't inspire any beauty or even elicit any form of intellectual reflection.it's better than gravity, but that doesn't say much!","character. writing. photography. acting. these things make critics swoon. i prefer entertainment, excitement, originality, imagination, intensity, emotion, drama and comedy. roma has none of those things.if you are quite young, or naive, or a film critic who goes gaga on the story of a normal sensitive young women you may like this film. if you want entertainment go elsewhere. boring movie.","there are a few undeniable things about 'roma.'  it's amongst the most gorgeously shot black and white films on record, which is all the more impressive considering alfonso cuarón serves as the film's writer, director, and cinematographer.  there's also no distinguishing between fiction and reality.  in particular, the actors in the movie make this slice-of-life film feel like it's a biography.  and finally, if 'roma' indeed goes on to win the oscar for best picture--right now it's certainly a contender--it'll eventually be saddled with the reputation of being undeserving of the honor, much like 'crash' or 'shakespeare in love.'the bottom line is that no matter how vividly shot a picture may be  (*cough cough* terrence malick), without an engaging plot, everything else is just cinematic masturbation.  lastly, a point of privilege: one reviewer fawned over alfonso cuarón's camerawork, setting expectations rather high.  however, while a number of sequences are indeed wonderfully shot, basic left-to-right or right-to-left pans aren't exactly innovative.  for comparison, watch 'shoplifters' while paying special attention to camera placement and movement.  it's nothing short of extraordinary and likely the best camera work of any film this year.","alfonso cuarón  created a cinema masterpiece with roma. beautifully directed, excellent performances and cinematography. cuarón balances nostalgia and sentiment just right without things getting overbearing but still gripping you. it’s a shame not more movies like this reach cinemas. in a world saturated by superhero movies and kid stuff one can only reminisce the good old times when cinema was truly in the hands of daring filmmakers with a vision. what does it say of our current movie going culture that everything is, so dumbed down?","roma reviewby chase m	not only is roma (2018) alfonso cuarnó’s most personal work, it’s also his best. the film grabs you from the first frame, and doesn’t let you go until the end of its 2:15 run time. cuarón’s mastery of the camera is evident in scene. every shot contains so much painstaking detail; you can’t help but feel the passion and commitment that went into this project. roma, is the story of cleo who works as a maid for a middle class family in the 1970s. the film documents a year in her life.	before i discuss anything else, let me heap more praise onto what cuarón did. to take these childhood experiences, and recreate them in such a loving way is something truly special. the writing in this film is simple yet moving. the film really made me care about, and connect with the character of cleo. cuarón’s cinematography is something to marvel at as well. each shot is beautifully presented, and the lighting is top notch all the way through. i could go on about how great the camera work is, but i won’t. just know it’s something special and go experience it.	the performances are all strong. particularly those of cleo and sofía, played by yalitza aparicio and marina de tavira. both embody the strong female figures that become the focus of the film. aparicio as a first time actress is particularly impressive, she delivers a powerful performance full of emotion. the acting nominations for these two, were well deserved.	roma is a masterpiece. it is the culmination of all the work alfonso cuarón has put in throughout his career. i was skeptical going in (mostly due to the fact that it’s a netflix movie) but i loved every second of it. this movie is a victory for foreign film makers everywhere. it’s a shame the academy didn't pick roma as ‘best picture’, because it deserved it more than any of the other nominees. regardless, roma is exceptional in every sense of the word and deserves to be experienced by anyone who appreciates the art of cinema. 10/10","'roma' is one of my favorite movies of 2018. 'roma' is not just a movie, it's a work of art. it is sentimental without being mushy. simply flawless","roma la tan aclamada película que habla sobre una criada indígena en el año 1971,la película como tal no está mal.esta muy bien ambientada,pero el único problema que encuentro es que la primera hora es pesada y la escena del desnudo es tan irrelevante, pero fuera de eso la encuentro entretenida más no una obra de arte","it feels difficult for other films to be able to match — or exceed — films like roma. it's hard to compete with this amazing film in the seasons of film awards in the coming weeks. beautiful cinematography, strong scripts, brilliant acting, are only part of the greatness of this film. roma, as a whole, is an amazing film and netflix has successfully made elitist parties think again about the films released by netflix. netflix succeeded in proving that their own films could succeed in various film festivals with very positive remarks. no doubt, roma is one of the best films of 2018 that cannot be missed.","this critics darling will find its nemesis with the general public. i mean, really , what is their to love. it's long, slow and largely uneventful. the baby scene and the swimming scene, which come towards the end of the film is as good as the drama gets. the most over rated film of this year which underlines how pretentious a lot of film critics are. come back bohemian rhapsody their was nothing to forgive!","i'm amazed that few, if any, critics have been talking about the great divide in this beautiful, poignant film:  the disparity between men and women.  it is a tribute to women - cleo, the protagonist, but also all who prominently appear:  the other housekeeper, adela, as well as the two patrician women in the household (though they are flawed, they are kind and loving overall), right down to the female obstetrician.  on the other hand, we have the men who abandon them and their families; the shooters;  the posers like fermin who show off to a point that becomes downright ridiculous (you will remember that scene); the ones in military bands who march through the streets for no apparent reason at all ... and who of course are flying the planes that intersect the sky throughout.  in the big martial arts demonstration in the field, who among them is able to execute the pose demonstrated by the teacher?  the martial arts students are all falling over, while (did i see this wrong?  the movie begs repeat viewings) isn't it cleo, among the women on the sidelines watching all this, who pulls it off?  is there one likable male character here at all?the ultimate message i got was that it is women who know how to love, while men are absorbed in themselves, to the point of disruption, and the most profound effect of this disparity is on the children.  women save and nurture while men work against them. the betrayed and abandoned wife says bluntly that women are always alone.  here, they are in one sense - that men disrespect them and/or fail to even stick around; but the women actually aren't alone.  it's love that binds them to each other, and to the children who could not thrive without them.  what an homage to the women who made cuaron such a sensitive director, and an exception to his gender (as he sees it) in doing so.","cuaron's roma is undoubtedly one of the best realistic films throughout history, i say this because you'll find yourself lost in roma, so immersed with how things are happening in a tedious way, much like life itself, that aspect of realism is fully captured by cuaron as he presents us with an insight so vivid and so clear and raw you could swear that you're watching a real-life events happening in front of you, it gives you the chance to observe and asses and more importantly feel and relate to strong emotions from pain to love and in a manner that is very genuine, in all honesty, roma is something really special, i can't start to describe how into it i was, i loved how cuaron chose his camera angels, to provide the maximum presence, it just flows naturally, again at times it feels all too real, and that right there is near impossible to capture in such manner, it takes and lot to make something so simple.the acting is spectacular, almost half the film we're presented with articulate shots that speaks volumes and doesn't need any dialogue to explain it, an also, cuaron's attention to the background which is a story in and of itself.what i'm trying to say here is roma is as pure as they come, it's like an untouched part of nature so beautiful and so wild, it demands admiration, so ultimately, roma is a fine piece of craft and an extremely rare gem, i absolutely, completely, utterly, fully enjoyed and loved this film, the power of film doesn't get stronger than this.",static camera and self-indulgent reminiscing?  some bits were great but it kinda seemed like one of those film school student films but longer.  much longer.,"roma is an astonishingly beautiful film filled to the brim with emotionally devastating and uplifting moments. yalitza aparicio and marina de tavira deliver oscar-worthy performances, however the star of this spectacle is director, writer, editor and cinematographer alfonso cuaron.","sublime, engrossing work. if you can't see it in theaters, lose yourself to a dark room, two hours on your laptop and a great pair of headphones.","simply the movie of the year.  a new renaissance of emotional film-making. there is one unnecessary scene that threatens to ruin the beauty of the rest of the movie, but i can forgive it because the rest of the movie is that good. outstanding film!update: post-netflix, the theater experience is superior to the television experience sadly. the sound is flat where in the theater it was immersive and 3d (such as the laundry scene and the hill scene with the animals), and the size and scale of the set really is not given its full due on a television screen. i can understand why people who saw this on their television might not get the hype, but it is so much more transporting when the sound/screen is done right. still a great movie, but it is sad to see and understand why people are not getting the hype/why people are so fascinated and impressed with this film.","one of the best films of the 21st century and definitely the best film of 2018. this is a level of masterpiece that doesn't come around often. it is beautifully, emotionally and dauntingly shot, one of the most daring film scripts of recent times, completed by excellent performances. the direction of cuarón balances subtle emotion and powerful sentiment in a rarely perfect manner, for any art form. it deserves to take home the majority of major oscars this year, in; best picture, best director, best lead actress, best original screenplay, best cinematography and many more.","at this point, it's either #1 or #2 on my movie-of-the-year list. there were a couple of moments in this film when the woman sitting next to me looked over because i unconsciously let out gasps.  incredibly emotional and beautifully shot.  yalitza aparicio as cleo is incredibly good in the role.  the hospital sequence and the beach sequence were two of the best scenes committed to film in recent years.  i knew going in it had to be good when joe morgenstern called it the best movie he's ever seen (though i was a bit skeptical of that for a time - felt like hyperbole), and it absolutely lived up to the hype.  this is a film that demands that you see it on the big screen with other people around you.  it's a human film that requires your not seeing it along.","beautiful, touching. amazing cinematography.a very smooth plot that makes the movie look like a short film how good is it.","the good: lack of hollywood superficiality and trite conventions. this is a film not a movie. there are many situations and moments inserted that are a bit strange and memorable.the unfortunate: there is almost no character development, and no certainly no arc to the story. as the film advances the story of the wife becomes important, but she oddly is left as a peripheral character. you come away without any insight into the main character, she is almost always an onlooker with little revealed.the bad: for a film shot in black and white, it was flat- no deep blacks, and an overly warm grey palette. the cinematography was usually wide angle, which means no close-ups of faces and eyes, contributing to the visual lack of character development. it felt like the director had a check-list of scenes drawn from mostly italian and italian neo-realism films. so while the film did not seem superficial, the effort was in the end more of a style exercise than emotional storytelling. i give it an 8 because movies today are so dreadful. this film is worth watching and discussing, but does not rise to be considered a truly great film.",very well done cinematically. beautiful story but not terribly original. entirely subtitled and therefore i assume it will be a foreign language contestant at the oscars and not best picture.,"just can't explain how much i liked this movie. must see if you're into good camera handling and good shots. quite slow movie but that makes you enjoy it more. 10/10 for me, absolutely.","con una trayectoria que abarca 9 películas (incluyendo a esta) el director mexicano marcó un estilo definido y reconocible, en la fotografía y edición. trajo escenas majestuosas como el plano secuencia final en niños de hombre o la escena inicial en gravedad. pero con esta consolida ese estilo implantado sus anteriores realizaciones.lavar los platos o limpiar el corredor de una casa se vuelve hermoso y se siente real. planos generales y pausados, mostrando la influencia que tiene de emmanuel lubezki con un trabajo excelente en la profundidad de campo, van envolviéndonos en la cotidianidad  de una empleada doméstica de una familia medio acomodada durante los 70. la estupenda fotografía de cuarón y la edición convierte a la película en una recordatorio fiel y con el mismo impacto de un documental sobre esa época, trayendo una experiencia sensorial pocas veces vista en una película.no solo la recreación de la época sorprende, sino el retrato que hace sobre el rol de la mujer en la familia a través de cleo, recordando y tributando con esperanza y deseos de reflexión. cuarón toma momentos de su vida para construir este relato contemplativo y pausado que llega a un punto de clímax pasando por escenas que hipnotizan por su complejidad y belleza. la actuación de yalitza aparicio cautiva desde el inicio, sin impostaciones ni sobre-actuación, mostrando una imagen honesta sobre su condición y además la soledad y miedo al desamparo. la nueva actriz a logrado conmover y mostrado su talento en esta película, que seguro sera recordada como lo mejor del cine latinoamericano moderno.","after watching this film i was moved to make an account.if artsy black and white footage of cleaning up dog **** is your thing, you will love roma.for everyone else, this is the emperor's new clothes of films. dull, self indulgent, tripe. the cinematography is occasionally beautiful, but the story and characters are slow and dull. very little happens, and that very little happens veeeerrrrry slowwwwwwwly.i stopped watching after about 90 minutes. i don't remember the last film that was so bad i didn't want to finish it.","intellectualise all you wish about the black and white, the nostalgia, the sentiment, the script, or whatever. i challenge you not to be moved by the human force of this movie. ace production design, and cuaron himself as cinematographer getting great shot after great shot, this is one of the movies of the century. loved the opening sequence, which is simply the maid sluicing the ceramic tiles - with the totally cuaron exception of a tiny airplane reflection in the gleaming water. he's put his best soul into this, and will never equal it.","wow. i understand that this film won't appeal to every single viewer's sensibilities, but i am just incredibly surprised/entertained at some of the commenters who seek to dilute this film to nothing more than a fluff piece about the importance of maids. if one were to do a simple google search (i know, imagine having the gall to do something so simple!), they would know that roma is a district in d.f. and not some highbrow reference or attempt at being avant-garde. based on the first user review here, it's almost like asking ""how dare a filmmaker give insight into a piece of history/their own past and how it factored into the greater societal conflicts of the time????"" i suppose we should only tell stories of westernized families who mostly resemble our own, correct? or even better, how about we simply disregard every history book and biographical novel who explains a worldview/experience different from our own! the fact that some reviewers have the audacity to call cleo a ""weak"" character reveals a failure to understand the ever fluctuating nature of a family's dynamics. there is no inherent hierarchy in roma's family, as the familial roles ebb and flow based on the unexpected internal and external situations the family find themselves in. losing one family member often translates to the rest of the family taking on new or unfamiliar roles and responsibilities. the long-term identity of a family (and ultimately, the values and identities of its children) is based on the members who become solidified in that family over several years. it's not about who the family started out with, it's about the members who stayed and formed the foundation. i wasn't aware that a film seeking to express and reflect on the development of a child's memory (cuaron's own) would be considered ""high-brow.""","""roma"" is the latest movie by a famous mexican director alfonso cuaron.cuaron is not only the director of this movie but also the

definitely oscar material.shot in black-and-white.","to practice for perfection.romacuaron's jaunting stay is frankly too practical to handle. mumbling the mundane lifestyle of a maid in a mellow vocab, cuaron has made his best film to date. first thing's first, the notable and yes loud cinematography of his is hauntingly beautiful. no one ever points out the facts that goes behind the camera on screen like such and even though it eerily resonates with anderson's symmetric camera work, it is a testament of its own for he himself was never able to speak effervescently like such. speaking of it, there barely resides a stable conversation in here, the bickerings, the murmurings, the gossip, every bit of narration is piled under such pragmatic state of environment. cuaron speaks through body language and physical sequences, to a point where they themselves become a character.the sequence of a car being parked is so absorbing to encounter it on screen, which then enfolds into another layer of perspective to its intention and then another and then another. cuaron keeps giving you reason- nay- he challenges you to get disengaged from this humble imbalanced world. and the host that he has selected to narrate this saga is a pure delight on terms of character development. surprisingly, to write such a character is a daunting task. for its persistency ought to be justified and he does it in here as a mere distraction; kudos to him.each time the protagonist is helping the younger ones or her employers, cuaron subconsciously maps out another milestone in your mind. the stillness of a scene staged in a room puts you right there on the spot among the actors, where you have to work your way through to concentrate the gossip or sort out the primary activity in a frame. amongst many steps that constructs this ingenious behemoth monument called drama, personally that speaks to you is the sort-of-training-camp where cuaron speaks honestly of his theme without any strings attached.the cast has done a fabulous work, from the lead aparicio as a humble supporter of this family and tavira as the real supporter of aparicio, along with the young cast which may resemble to the younger cast of malick's the tree of life. but cuaron's dish is not spiced up with plethora of ingredients like malick's, his sweetness is competent enough to tick for its course. cuaron's span spent upon screen is a mesmerizing poem weaved out to clean and scrub a house properly.and boy what a poem it is, dipped into a metaphorical tone, it soars just like those planes hovering around in the background. for the most part of it, cuaron keeps the frame under the shades, teasing us to seek for the action going on and similar to it the storytelling too feeds on our imagination that is at brisk all the time, especially the last act that scares you with the closure that you are trying to achieve. roma narrows down cinema to a better quality, cuaron makes sure it isn't compromised for any reason whatsoever, not even for him.","¿porqué no hay cineastas como cuarón trabajando actualmente en méxico? roma es una belleza de película desde principio a fin. la mejor película del año porque hace lo que muy pocas películas hacen, mostrarnos la belleza y la tristeza del día a día."
Ran, akira kurosawa was a visionary his work was the best a japanese director has ever put out. yes this is based on king lear and is a genius copy as well. the sequences of violence show the different customs that japan had and also the conflict between the sons and the father was shown amazingly. the fact is you will never find a better japanese film besides ran and seven samurai in your life and if you do you better post a review because i would like to know.,"not to say that it's a bad movie, i just had a real hard time getting into it. i was already pretty familiar with king lear going into this film so nothing storywise really surprised me. it looks great and was well acted but the film did little to get and maintain my interest.","ran is a masterpiece. personally, i do not give out perfect ratings often. every few months, maybe more, a film comes along that stuns me so thoroughly that a rating that is not a perfect score feels like heresy. ran is that kind of film. from the story to the score to the cinematography to the colors, the film is a lyrical and poetic masterpiece from director akira kurosawa. based on king lear, ran depicts the transfer of power from an old lord to his eldest son, only for him to be subjected to watching his three sons destroy all that he built. a film about chaos of the mind and the world, ran develops themes of family, respect, honor, nihilism, and postmodernism. an epic of profound scope, delicately brought to life by kurosawa, ran  is a film that immediately becomes one of my personal favorites.depicting the fall of the house of ichimonji (fake), ran is an exercise in trusting and respecting those that you what is on their mind, rather than lie to your face but cover it in complimentary words. in this way, great lord hidetora (tatsuya nakadai) is doomed to watch his lands fall to ruin after opting to trust those that to lie to him, if only because they bowed before him when they did it. though the sons will be blamed for fracturing the family, in many ways, hidetora fractured the family and the family was always doomed to fail. as he had three sons, the power struggle would have continued no matter when hidetora died. in many ways, this could be described as ran's way of showing that our actions do not mean anything (nihilism) and everything is pre-determined for us (free-will or lack thereof). this is even mentioned by one character who says to not blame the gods for what occurs because everything has already been determined. thus, it can certainly be concluded that the ichimonji were doomed from the start to fracture. however, by trusting his unfaithful sons over his most faithful son because he spoke his mind, hidetora merely sped up the demise.additionally, ran is an exercise in violence begetting violence. towards the end, when hidetora's life is one again struck with tragedy at the hands of his son's violence towards one another, he asks ""is there no justice?"" though his pain is authentic and he is incredibly sympathetic, hidetora losing his sons to war is justice in its purest form. throughout the film, we see castles of lords killed by hidetora. we are introduced to daughters that were witnesses to hidetora slaughtering their families, only to then be married off to one of hidetora's sons. for hidetora to suffer as he made others suffer - by watching his family be destroyed - is justice and demonstrates that you ""reap what you sow"" and ""violence begets violence"".ran also heavily discusses chaos. in fact, its title translates to ""chaos"". yet, the chaos in the film is two-fold: of the mind and of the world. as he family falls apart, hidetora goes mad. his mind is very literally chaos. though he has moments of lucidity, his insanity destroys his mind and memory, causing him to forget what his sons look like and forgetting who a faithful servant was. all of these moments are painful to see, in particular with the servant. faithful from the beginning, kyoami (shinnosuke ikehata) is distraught to see his master forget who he is and the audience certainly feels his pain. the madness of hidetora, however, is matched by the now war torn region he is surrounded by. with bloodshed, plots for power, and intrafamily conflicts, there is very little chaos and the film reflects this with long, drawn out battle sequences highlighting every element of brutality. though chaos appears to happen quickly from the outside, it actually comes from very precise and small steps and ran goes to great lengths to show the slow descent into chaos experienced by the house of ichimonji. from plotting wives to power hungry siblings, the collapse is hardly a gradual one.as with many japanese films, ran also delves into themes of family, respect, and loyalty. in particular, respect and loyalty are a large element of the film. with long scenes of men showcasing their loyalty by bowing or following their master into battle, ran develops a constant theme of loyalty. though some loyal men die, their loyalty is always celebrated, in particular when they do not stay quiet and instead speak their minds. even if rebuked, they are proven to be right in the end and their original objections were proven to be justified. had their warnings been headed, the collapse of the ichimonj would not have happened. as such, ran could be called a celebration of contrarians. though they are unpopular figures, the words they speak come from the heart and should be heard clearly, in order to avoid making a fatal error.","akira kurosawa's final epic, ran, takes on william shakespeare's king lear. to me, from head to toe, this kurosawa's picture which symbolizes downfall is absolute stunning  such gorgeousness in a film is utterly rare, and of course, it is one of the kurosawa's many best films. ran is a success  having nominated for academy awards for best art direction, best cinematography, best costume design and best direction and won one. ran was also nominated for a golden globe for best foreign language film. i repeat this  ran, from head to toe, is absolutely stunning, and of course this movie is perfect. the film's cinematography, which is top notch, is a killer. the way kurosawa captured the images of burning castle, a moving horses, dead soldiers, battle scenes are all undeniably respectable, and sublime too, and one great example would be the scenes where the attack of the third castle was occurring. very much in evidence that kurosawa's talent in film-making is transcending. the film's script which was being written by kurosawa himself, hideo oguni and masato ide is yet admirable. the exploitation on poetic lines are proved to be effective and fitting for the movie. one would see great performances in ran. good acting by the players, but to me, the two actors who stood up above the rest are tatsuya nakadai and mieko harada. tatsuya nakadai plays the great lord tatsuya nakadai. the great lord is old, fragile and somewhat defenseless and the character is well characterized by him. mieko harada plays a female villain lady kaede, whose character is hungry for revenge. her amazing performance which is raw and gripping, plays a very important part for the success of the movie. surely there are several movie elements which are worthy to be carried out for discussions, but to me, the main highlight of ran is its cinematography, and it is one hell of a show. [10/10] facebook (http://facebook.com/alex.desmall) twitter (@alex_desmall) (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/alexdesmall)","what makes ran any different? is it from how you see it? if it is, you probably have to step up your game (or movie as i say) because ran is an amazing movie worth seeing twice.",an absolute cinematic masterpiece and by far my favorite movie by great visionary kurosawa.,"a masterpiece for the ages, akira kurosawa's visionary feat inspired by william shakespeare's play ""king lear,"" is an exercise in cinematic achievement. ran's provocative use of color, to its deft handling of its often shrewd, manipulative characters, is virtually unparalleled in cinema. as film critic roger ebert pointed out, one feels as if they are ""gods"" observing the action unfold as they view ran. kurosawa's lack of closeups, gives the viewer a distance to these characters, who very rarely deserve the audiences' sympathy. having passed away in 1998, kurosawa has left behind a legendary filmography, ran being just one of his many films of supreme artistic quality.","this film takes the shakespeare play and adapts it to make a big epic film while still being trajic and emotional too. everything in this film (production-wise) looks amazing, from the buildings to the costumes to the furntiture, you can tell that the people behind this spent there money wisely and with intent. the acting is also incredible showing the emotions each character in feeling with full intense detail, especially lord ichimonji. this film is a truly wonderful watch showing an amazing blend of beautiful imagery, intense emotion, story, and writing. i definitely suggest watching it.","my akira's kurosawa's favourite film, in my opinion the most epic film of the director. its a perfect masterpiece. the plot, the caracthers, the photography, costume, the soundtrack everything of this film its incredible. korusawa has been the greatest japanese film director ever been and one of the greatest over old the wolrd and the history of cinema.","reaping the whirlwindakira kurosawa’s “ran”“vanity of vanities, says the preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity.”“for they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.”“but if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the lord, and be sure your sin will find you out.”what a difference 33 years makes(duh!) when i first saw this movie in 1985 i just knew if was a great movie. i was totally captivated by the attack on the third castle(which i still am) but it has now become obvious to me how all truly great works of art are hopelessly(hopefully?) entangled with the biblical worldview(even if the director doesn’t embrace that view.) although you would expect kurosawa to be a buddhist he seems to acknowledge that the eightfold path does not succeed in conquering suffering. indeed, the son who returns at the end does “not” cure the chaos(oh how kurosawa could have used the conquering messiah of the christian faith here!) tsurumaru’s drop of the amira buddha image near the end also seems to indicate a lack of faith in the buddhist way.but the other christian themes reflected in the quotes above are beautifully explored here.mise en scène score(20/20) kurosawa is a master here. the scene in which hidetora exits the second castle is gorgeous. as is the overhead shot in the ruins with hidetora and kyoami. although the attack on the third castle is not static there are many powerful images here as well. the final shot of tsurumaru matches the bleakness of the final shot in vertigo, and repeats the theme of a fall from great height(the garden of eden?)the attack on the third castle(30/30) if this isn’t the greatest sequence in movie history it is surely the greatest sequence without dialogue. how can such carnage be so captivatingly presented? this type of “operatic” violence is what peckinpah presents at the end of “wild bunch” but raised to a higher degree.proverbs 22:6 score(30/30) the inverse holds true as well. even though saburo escapes this tendency(by the grace of god?) he can’t save the day in the end.revenge vs. forgiveness/loyalty score(10/10) the sins of hidetora, taro and jiro come full circle as lady kaede takes her revenge. but lady sué’s way of forgiveness, and the loyalty of tango and kyoami, stand out as the way forward.acting score(4/5) hidetora’s death seemed overacted to me.worldview score(4/5) perfect presentation of our hopeless state without god. what kurosawa needs is the nun from vertigo to offer hope.98/100","this the most mature, most beautiful and heartfelt war movie i have ever seen.ran is a masterful adaption of king lear by akira kurosawa.",one of my favourite kurosawa`s films.there is everything deserves to be praised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12 Angry Men,"this is the worst movie off all time. there aren't any explosions, there aren't any guns, and lastly the movie is in black and white!!! what, do they think i'm some old granny who is going to watch something without color? hell no!","the power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic.the story to 12 angry men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way.12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and i think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 angry men paid off brilliantly.the acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. i wish i can bring up every single actors name in this cast but i'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and i can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but i can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. nicely done fellas.sidney lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing i've seen from this guy. he really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.the characters in the movie (the twelve angry men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. as a viewer myself i got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.for problems with the movie: i don't have any.overall 12 angry men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. you haven't seen 12 angry men then i say go see it, it's worth your time.","intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young puerto rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. however, juror henry fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. he votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. fonda is great, but lee j. cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). ed begley, martin balsam, jack warden, jack klugman, joseph sweeney, e.g. marshall and john fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. an excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers.","can a movie about 12 angry men in 1 room for more than an hour be any good? yes. yes it can. ""12 angry men"" is a really cool movie that has lots of moments that made me say ""ahhhaaa!"". the characters are really interesting and entertaining throughout, and some are really likable/hate-able, in a good way. i was interested for the whole movie, that alone makes it worthy of a few points.",the story is flawless in every way possible. the acting is pretty good. the editing is pretty good. the character-development is spectacular. nothing bad to say about it. it's the only non-documentary movie i would give a 10/10.,"12 men in one room deciding the fate of another. what should be a boring movie is really a brilliant one. with an excellent script, the cast does a fantastic job selling their characters and the turmoil each one goes through as they ultimately find their way to the truth.",classic movie with a very intelligent plot about the us court system and great dialogues. everyone who loves movie should see this film.,"example that less is more, 12 angry men is ridden by only a scenario, 12 characters and a killing script, giving a show of dynamism in few resources.","sidney lumet's use of styled realism, the tension that builds up from different personalities, and cracking dialogue make ""12 angry men"" a perfect masterpiece that is contemporary in any age.","this is the master class of film making, acting and directing.  on the surface it is about 12 jurors that are counseling about a verdict in a murder case. on the inside it is as much about the jurors themselves, justice, life philosophies, psychology, group dynamics and responsibility. the whole movie takes place in just one room. there are no distractions and each misstep would hurt this movie badly. this is the ultimate strength of this movie. there are no mistakes, out of character moments, bad dialogues, wasted scenes or other errors. the cast and the acting is so close to perfection as possible. each juror delivers his role in such a genuine way that i cant find a single flaw in this movie. if i praise the actors i must also praise the director sidney lumet. he should definitely have gotten more oscars in his career (he made many great movies).  i want also to mentioned that i first watched this movie when i was 12 or 13 years old just by zapping trough the channels. this was something that shouldn't work at this age. i stopped zapping and started to watch this movie with fascination. as i got older it got even better as i did understand many things more with my additional life experience. overall this is a timeless classic that is deservedly highly praised and should be watched by everyone at least once.",intense but i think i liked it. at this point just watch it so you don't feel left out....,"12 men seated in a room discussing whether or not a man should be judged for is crimes. a movie that completely revolves around the characters and ideas rather than anything else. i adored this movie simply because it is a movie that appears to be so simplistic and yet is able to convey a deeper message than any other. the elaborate discussion of right vs wrong, justice vs. injustice, and the ability of humanity to deliver doubt. a personal favorite simply because it was able to keep me entertained while doing so little.","""it's just 12 men in a room for an hour and a half! boring! 0/10!"" this is why people love this movie haha. it is 12 different men with different outlooks on life being isolated in a confined space having to use the english language as a mean to compromise and persuade one another during a murder investigation for 90 minutes. yes. yet it's one of the most riveting movies i've ever seen, few movies have had me this invested. seeing our main character, played brilliantly by henry fonda, at the start of the movie being completely alone voting against the execution one by one convincing the 11 other men to vote the same as him is an experience i think everyone should experience. during the final act i lost count of how many times i said ""this **** guy"" out loud. a very solid movie choice for a first black and white experience. brilliant, just brilliant.","best movie ever ever ever ever ever made!!!! period!!!!if you don't like this film, not only you have no taste at all, but you have no idea about cinema. a masterpiece!!","uma obra magnifica, com um dos roteiros mais poderosos da história do cinema. este tipo de obra nos mostra que não é necessário nada em abundância para que se possa produzir um bom filme. é necessário apenas muito.. muito talento.",this is a timeless classic. stunning performace by the cast. for a low budget movie this is a suprising piece of entertainment.,"the movie was a bit predictable, but the execution was so damn good! especially the ending! 9,5/10","a very good movie with very few resources, the best directors are those who do more with less and that's why sidney lumet was a genius of cinema.",my score 100metascore / user score 96 / 94tomatometer / audience score 100 / 97imdb 89(96),"‘12 angry men’ does not use names and could be set anywhere. each character represents the different characters in society and its deeply-rooted flaws. hence, it paints a bigger picture of constitutional inequality and susceptibility to manipulation within the american judicial system that all countries can relate to, including singapore. hence, this movie serves as a poignant warning that everyone has a social responsibility to respect the judicial system as a platform to protect individual rights, regardless of background.","despite the fact that ‘12 angry men’ was produced near 60 years ago, the messages it conveys is very much relevant to today’s world and society. it gives a lot of food for thought regarding issues of prejudice and is a prime example as to how a negotiation should and should not be done. my main take away from this film would be the importance of keeping an open mind when approaching people and issues. we need to be constantly be aware of our own personal bias and think critically, never taking things at face value. through this process, we can then be more enlightened and make wiser decisions and opinions.","12 angry men illustrates the difficult process of arriving at a common consensus when 12 jurors were tasked to evaluate the innocence of an 18-year-old boy accused of first-degree murder. this movie, though stylistically simple due to the lack of scene changes, manages to provide an engaging watch by interweaving the intricacies involved in negotiations. several techniques were reflected in the film, namely separating people from the problem, distinguishing positions and interests, and the importance of using objective criteria to invent and evaluate options. definitely worth a watch.","this film is, without any doubt, a masterpiece and one of the best films of all time. it is undoubtedly a must-see movie.","12 angry men did a great job representing the different characteristics and personalities that were involved in that room. it showed how hostile a jury can be even when evidence may seem so true, every angle must be examined. i loved how some of the jury members would actually get so angry to the point that they would end up committing a murder! throughout the entire movie you were just on your seat for what shocking new evidence or a point of view would change the minds of each jury member. it was funny to think it was 11 against 1 and that 1 man voiced his opinion so well that the rest of the group was able to change their stubborn results. if you have an opinion speak it! it could potentially save a life!",12 angry men is one of the best works of american cinema. with its story that represents an accurate picture of what being on a jury can be like. it engages audiences with its murder mystery plot making every line of dialogue of somewhat importance to unraveling the truth about the mystery.,a pure masterclass piece of cinema!not even a single sec i felt it was shot in the single room with just arguments it's really gripping.every single sec makes us feel we are going in a way making the judgement of not guilty! ending explains the all when two different perspectives people are eager to make there point!it's really a classic!,"i am a small business owner with more than 60 employees and this movie is part of our company orientation meaning that each new hire is required to watch this movie and discuss with this colleagues. it defines our company dna: never accept the majority opinion without your own input, always defend your point and never give in. truly a masterpiece.","96 minutes, 12 men, in a room. but nobody said that it is boring film. sidney lumet is genius artist. i fund it when i saw find me guilty and i believe it surly when i saw 12 angry men.","exceptional utilization of symbolism, intentional framing, and cinematography to highlight the subtle but significant reaction of each juror's exchange. for a show that was created a long time ago, it is still able to teach valuable and relevant lessons to its viewers. ‘prejudice always obscures the truth’. to uncover more than what meets the eye, the movie brought us on a journey from the start point of a seemingly undeniable crime, to the end point of feelings being opposite from the surface decision. what seemed to be an undeniable murder on the surface convinced 11 out of the 12 jurors to vote ‘guilty’, with juror 8’s vote of ‘not guilty’ causing an uproar that started the process of negotiation in an attempt to understand as much as possible before making a decision.","one if the greatest movie ever made,  sidney lumet’s debut holds good even today, this movie is a perfect example of how to use limited resources - space and use camera, lighting, framing and editing.",the movie is great because it's just 12 guys arguing about whether someone is guilty or not and it's very interesting.,عالی پیشنهاد میکنم حتما ببینید شاهکار اور هنری,utterly spectacular film.it is about responsibility to all of us.film tells us how it is bad to be apolitical .,"i heard this movie was perfect. and for what it is, for what it’s based on, i have a hard time disagreeing. i genuinely don’t know how much better this movie could possibly be. it’s set in a single room for at least a 98% majority of it. meaning it’s not visually interesting, especially because it’s a black and white movie, but that’s not something that bothered me aside from the start. that’s something i should talk about i suppose. at the start i wasn’t convinced i would enjoy the movie and then it really started and i really got into it. the characters are interesting, and though not everyone is super fleshed out, they don’t really need to be at all. you get all you really need from each of them. the story is simple but it’s everything it needs to be to create an interesting experience, the acting is pretty phenomenal. for my personal enjoyment i thought it was great. as a film making achievement it’s also pretty great. it depicts a very real-feeling situation. not that it’s something that would happen every day but in the context of the story they laid out it all makes total sense. and frankly it’s fascinating. the dialogue isn’t always amazing but that fact makes sense given they’re showing us real people.","best movie of it's kind ever.  the actors? amazing. the story? amazing.  watch it, now.","12 angry men is basically a courtroom drama with diverse characters, brilliant screenplay, and a tight script-making it a flawless thrillride.the movie is about 12 people trying to decide whether a boy is guilty or not. it ultimately teaches us about the value of human life.it is perfect movie for me - a movie without any flows .","it seems cool,very informative and protesting drama.i have ever seen like that before",this is the best movie of the last century for me. the concept is just awesome.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Manchester by the Sea,"i left this movie wanting to find an oscar to immediately hand over to casey affleck. his restrained but deeply moving performance has easily been one of my favorites of the year. the movie is filled with impressive acting from everyone involved, but i feel like so much of it hinges on his ability to make his character's quietest and stillest moments say so much.the movie is a powerful exploration of grief that works so well because it remembers that people don't stop making sarcastic comments and stupid jokes when things are awful. it's the humor that makes the sadness more genuine and affecting, because the characters feel more human and real.it's one of my favorite films of the year.","worth seeing twice, in my opinion. i left the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed after first seeing it, but i went back the next night and felt i better understood why it garnered such overwhelming praise. affleck's performance is truly remarkable; again, i couldn't appreciate it as much the first time i saw it, but after developing a better understanding of the character (don't want to reveal anything), i appreciated how challenging of a performance it was for casey. the film is raw and visceral, and really offers an interesting perspective on the grieving process and the effects it can have on a person.",film is incredible!!! casey affleck and michelle williams are heartbreakingly moving and stunning! gonna be a long but fruitful awards season i think for them!! whole cast and overall picture are a must see!,"manchester by  z's seems like an appropriate name for this film. i understand how well this was filmed. the acting was brilliant, as a character lee chandler neither neither hatable nor likable. he's damaged and broken and the film does a great job of contrasting the changes which have come about in his life. the dialogue is interesting as well, the characters have interesting lines and they move the film along interestingly.however, the movie is one in which very bad things happen to people and are accentuated by smaller bad things happening to them. intellectually i understand this is a great movie. the book is about a group of aimless characters who drift through life, drift through the movie and then drift out. they have no purpose just like this movie. i know you are probably reading this and wondering ""why is he giving this an eight if he doesn't have anything good to say about it?"" well objectively speaking i believe there are many elements which go into making a film really good : acting, directing, sound, plot. from a technical and objective perspective this movie is excellent. it is an extremely well made, well acted and technically well done film. however, i never really felt invested in the movie. i didn't want the movie to end up being some hackneyed film where the character finds redemption, find a new love in his old city, and moves forward in some way. but at the same time i wish there was more to it.","manchester by the sea is a very touching human drama, marked by loyalty to reality. evaluates mourning from three points of view, how each one faces it, the relationships that are forced to come up and how some things make sense, so you can learn from them and grow; but others don’t make sense and will stay forever with you as a burden. first we have lee chandler, hunted by a past to be revealed, not eager for human contact and that lost interest in life, practically an automaton. second is his nephew patrick, going through adolescence, very closed to himself, shielding in girlfriends, friends, a band, the town, in order to escape from the true. third we see protagonist’s ex-wife randi confused by mixing past and present due to recent events that rise repressed feelings buried down below. those three performances are amazing, casey affleck is carries out the movie, lucas hedge surprised me a lot and michelle williams is heartbreaking. the direction and screenplay are strong, without fear of showing the real world. and those violin solos create a unique soundtrack.",good movie but wouldn't say it's oscar worthy. casey always puts on great performances. story is slow paced alot of times it seems like thier is nothing going on. horrific background interwoven into the story and michelle williams is great as she always is. the guy that played casey nephew got a lot of praise but i think he just did a passable job. overall the movie is watchable but don't expect anything ground breaking or anything that will suck you into the movie.,"one of my biggest issues of a very dominant trend in both filmmaking and tv shows in the past few years is the overbearing strive and subsequent critical acclaim for material that is heavily realistic, presents ""complex and flawed"" characters, but there is a complete lack of central morality or moral lens for the viewer. if anything about good and evil, right or wrong, morality in general is touched upon, it is strictly restrained to moral relativism, where it's always ""up to the viewer"" to form their own feelings, the filmmaker tries not to offer the slightest clue about his or her stance on the issues. pretty much every last ""critically acclaimed"" tv show these days falls under this category, and a plethora of movies, manchester by the sea being the most recent example of the ones i have seen, though it's really not about one or two examples.the issue i have with this ""non judgmental"" trend is that i firmly believe art, truly great art, should in some shape or form benefit society, not simply present it ""as is."" when society celebrates stories of moral relativism, it adopts moral relativism. things that were, and for good reason, seen as clearly wrong, suddenly become ""complex,"" up for personal interpretation, depending on ""circumstance."" and if challenged, the excuse is always ""oh i'm not endorsing this, i'm just portraying real life without judging. this is what people do.""but when art abandons teaching moral messages, that contributes to society becoming morally anchorless and losing its scope of what's right or wrong. no, this definitely is not an argument about ""violent movies influence violence in real life"" or anything of the sort - it's not about what is portrayed, but how it is portrayed. and morality seems to have been sacrificed by many filmmakers on the altar of realism, with both public and critical acclaim embracing this with both arms.","affleck has done the impossible - dramatized an interior pain in a consistently affecting manner.  women usually get the roles for articulating unbridled expression regarding loss, divorce, etc.  that's not the way this man suffers.  affleck deserves every accolade.  the film is not for those who need a car chase, but it's a a human story, wonderfully written and rendered.  michele williams didn't have as much to do, as she was less 'written.'  affleck's nephew in the film is utterly superb as well.","the story-telling is good with flashbacks that give you insights on lee's life. the film is both funny and heartbreaking. you smile in a scene and get a soulcrushing revelation in the next. because they, as i said, give you an insight on the main character story as the film goes on. the acting by casey affleck is very very good. he deserved the oscar. is a bittersweet masterpiece on the theme of loss and guilt. one of the best films of 2016.","depressing, disjointed, and extremely disappointing!  don't waste your time on this pathetic, aweful movie.","this is the one that made me realize i should ignore the critics. as for the movie, when life is that bad - you get help. you have to get help or something really bad will happen. shame on the critics - i think it is called schadenfreude - disgusting","i am not sure what to think about this movie. the acting is generally very good. michelle williams sticks out as the real star although casey affleck seems to be getting all the hype. affleck is a great fit for the role. however, he plays the exact same role he plays in all of his movies which makes me wonder about his actual acting capabilities. it's perfect for this movie though. i am concerned that casey affleck is like klaus kinski or woody allen who only can play themselves.the movie is well shot and has a profound story that's well written. the movie would have been better if it had taken itself a little bit less serious and been sped up a little bit at times, especially in the first half.","this is a movie about a man with a volatile temper who is haunted by his past (we find out why towards the end of the movie).  since the main character and the teenaged nephew who has the main secondary role are not immediately sympathetic characters, the film needs to keep the filmgoers interested with the plot and the personal growth of the characters.  unfortunately, casey affleck never really experiences any personal growth, and ends the film the same as he started.  matthew broderick is totally wasted in a cameo role.  the scenery is beautiful, but the film is way too slow moving.","i don't think i've ever seen a film nearly as 'human' as this. every single performance in this movie is astounding, nothing comes across fake, or even acted. such a fantastic movie, it is a damned shame this movie is not a wide release. if you have the chance to see this movie, do.","""manchester by the sea"" asks how do you survive an unimaginable tragedy?? people handle it in different ways and lee (casey affleck) becomes a totally cold, uncaring person who cuts himself off from all those he loves, leaves his hometown, gets a job as a janitor in boston, drinks a lot of beer and has fights in bars.the first hour of the film deals with lee before and after the tragedy, how he was a happy man, father, husband, brother and friend before he became the loner he is now. after his brother, joe, (kyle chandler) dies, he comes home to find out that joe has appointed lee the guardian of his 16 year old nephew patrick (lucas hedges) who in many ways is a typical teenager but is acting out upon the death of his father. at this point the director/screenwriter, kenneth lonergan, tells us what the tragedy was and it is almost to painful for the audience to hear and watch. for the next hour and 17 minutes we see how uncle and nephew interact and deal with life, patrick with humor and sarcasm, lee without emotions and staying as uninvolved as he can stay. we meet patrick's mother elise (gretchen mol) who has been out of his life for years, her new husband jefferey (matthew broderick) lee's ex-business partner and friend george (c. j. wilson) but most important of all lee's ex-wife, randi (michelle williams).while affleck is getting all the attention in the reviews i was more impressed with 20 year old lucas hedges as the 16 year old who can break your heart and a second later having you laugh. affleck does a strong job especially since most of his scenes have to be done in a monotone, showing no emotion and fighting the pull his nephew on has him as a human being.michelle williams has a very emotional scene, lasting about 5 minutes, with casey affleck but as easily as i am moved in a movie's emotionally scenes, this didn't move me.gretchen mol is wasted and matthew broderick has a very thankless part. the rest of the supporting players including  patrick's main girlfriend played by anna baryshnikov are all above par.i love heavy, family, movie dramas but the bottom line is that ""manchester by the sea"" is way too long by 15-20 minutes which doesn't make for very much tension and though the scenery of manchester by the sea is excellent in all the seasons and there is no fault with the acting i don't recommend it.oh, yes, a very distracting soundtrack that more than once takes you out of the story.",mindblowing. lonergan's amazing writing is paired with astounding performances from the actors. definitely gonna be remembered for many years to come.,"sir alfred hitchcock once said, ""i don't make slices of life pictures.  i prefer slices of cake.""  this is a prime example of why he expressed that sentiment and why he was the master, and why so many are students of his to this day.  the filmmakers of this little indie slice of life film are not.  not that there is anything wrong with that, but it is naive not to realize the tenants of suspense apply to all stories and genres, that any good movie needs some form of imagination.the writer/director here is trying to pass off a lazy, half baked, self indulgent, contrived excuse for a movie that is very slow, dreadfully boring, poorly edited (in the sense of economy of running time), and unevenly acted (at times it's naturalistic and real, while at others it's painfully forced and phony, with casey affleck delivering a suitably competent performance but certainly not outstanding by any sane measure)... and the critics just ate it up!  they swallowed the pretentious void of story craft and lack of dynamics hook, line and sinker, as the herd on the scent of pretentious art films does, so often mistaking the pretense of art for actual accomplished audience pleasing work, or even difficult opaque but still highly worthy endeavors that require work on the audience's part.  this thing is neither.  moviemakers should always work for the audience, not the other way around.  that means even with difficult, challenging or disturbing material the work of story craft in a narrative must be done before it's given to the audience.  to just throw up on screen some ramblings and musings (no matter how tragic or melancholic) that a screenwriter jacked off on the page and called it a day is no excuse for the lack of quality entertainment or ""art"" in any genuine sense of the word when it comes to the cinema.of course the academy flock will also delight full course on this unpalatable slice of s--- too.  meanwhile we, those in and who work for the audience, shake our heads in disgust at the obscene deranged over-praise.","nope. not sure why this even made it into the nominations. this is a slow drag with one good scene. i'm sure there's some super intellectual reason why i'm wrong, but it doesn't change the fact that i was bored and disconnected from this movie.","i don't care how great the acting is in this movie, it was not entertaining for me and i found it to be just dark, dreary and depressing.  if i had a dollar for each time we were in a car, the movie would have more than paid for itself.  if you are looking to be entertained, this is not the movie for you.  the story is depressing and casey affleck's character is depressed.  there is no humor at all in any scene.  awful!","manchester by the sea is objectively one of the best oscar bait movies i have seen. the acting is grounded and always character consistent. the character consistency is the key to the overall film’s success. kenneth lonergan’s directorial accomplishment is utilized to anchor moments that might otherwise be drama cliche. the character consistency would, of course, be an even more impossible task without an excellent cast. casey affleck will undoubtedly get the quarterback like attention at the oscars. what that comment means is i failed to see a single bad performance from the rest of the cast. for narrative, the contemplative structure allows the viewer a chance of gaining character insight without letting moments explicitly define the players. a tragic event will occur and a given scene only allows a character minor fallout before a transition in time. the cinematography is fine with an excellent focus on the little quirks one might find in a small new england town. in addition, the blend of cinematography and location lends to the rare cinematic experience of a story feeling like it came from a genuine place. manchester is an uncomfortable film when it comes to dishing out any form of conclusion. the result is a narrative more in line with postmodern sensibilities. the ending can easily be dismissed as a typical indie climax. however, the conclusion is anything but a simple artistic gimmick. seeing the ending as a gimmick robs rewarding the narrative of its logical continuation. in fact, i daresay manchester by the sea contains one of the year's best movie endings. to summarize, the butterfly-like effect of grief is the central theme i pinned down. the question, ""do i deserve forgiveness?"" is also asked. i can’t say i admired the film as much on a personal level. the film contained a lot of scenes which were a little long for my taste. additionally, the movie works better as an example of fine filmmaking over anything i can take with me in life. many people will see the film as a relatable experience but nothing more. i am curious as to how long the movie will stay in the minds of the average viewer. definitely, see the film for its cinematic accomplishments.","critics love this movie, and i expected something good.but i was not ready for this. the film surpassed all my expectations.directing, acting, cinematography, script, attention to details. superb!in my opinion, this movie is by far the best this year.i hope it will win oscar in february.directed by kenneth lonergan.main character lee chandler played by casey affleck.another stellar performance is of his ex-wife randi played by michelle williams.","a moderately entertaining character study with relatively profound explorations of issues like redemption, forgiveness and understanding one's limitations. but it's also often an exercise in taking itself way too seriously, with more than a few pregnant pauses, lingering shots of mugging emoting and throwaway slice-of-life sequences. casey affleck and lucas hedges turn in capable but overrated performances, though michelle williams steals the show with what should be an oscar-winning supporting portrayal. enjoy this one, but don't get taken in by the hype.","i have never cried and laughed at the same time in a film, however, there is a first time for everything. kenneth lonergan's manchester by the sea is easily the best film this year. i guess i should start with the acting, which is also the best this year. casey affleck shines in his role as lee, a grieving uncle/brother with a dark past. i am not one who can see the future but i can easily say that affleck will be getting a best actor nomination if not win best actor. among the other future nominees, lucas hedges is a welcome surprise in his role as patrick, lee's nephew. finally, michelle williams will probably be getting a best supporting actress nomination in her role as randie. the acting in this film is impeccable and it definitely helps it destroy you emotionally. another stand out is the writing, people are probably saying that this is the saddest film this year but they forget the fact that the film has a lot of humor. the humor is very unique in that its a stinging humor, every joke has an insult behind it (which is great). the direction and the cinematography is amazing and really adds to the amazing sense of place that this film has. you can really tell where you are (i don't really know how to explain it but it's good). overall, this film is unlike many that are made these days. it doesn't spoon feed you exposition, it lets you come to conclusions on your own and it is very rewarding. also, the film doesn't have a linear storyline yet it all makes sense. and like life, it doesn't have some perfect ending where everyone's happy, it is real and it feels as such. in closing, it would be a disservice to oneself not to see this movie because it is unequivocally the best film this year.",i was really looking forward to this movie because of the hype. well acted.  well photographed. and interesting story.  but it wasn't entertaining for me.  i really didn't feel the emotion or the empathy.  not sure why not.  it lacked something.,"this movie was a waste of two hours with good acting.  no real plot line, just two hours of footage of some dude.  utterly terrible movie, truly stunned it has such good reviews.","first of all i loved the pictures in this movie.i just couldnt turn my eyes away for a minute. and then well casey affleck . outstanding perfomance. on the one hand the old happy guy and then now one of the most depressed heroes of the last years so amazingly performed. even his eyes and his silence was hurting,mourning. just thank you and bravo.",this is a work of art. simple yet complex. the directing and the writing by kenneth lonergan manages to be really elegant and told in a very subtle way.,"this has to be the most overrated movie of all time.  i'm not opposed to a slower movie, i have the patience.  but this movie was so boring. absolutely nothing happens.  i am stunned that it has this high of ratings.",casey affleck isn't like his brother ben affleck because he is still a rising star. this film deserved to win picture of the year at the golden globe awards. i think that this film has the potential of winning at least one oscar scene it has been nomanated for six.,"a man and a boy, one an uncle, one a nephew, are engaged in an intimate fishing lesson off the lake on manchester, connecticut. this melodic view takes us from here through the uncle’s cold spiritual journey of knowing his place amidst the chaos of death.manchester by the sea is written and directed by kenneth lonergan (gangs of new york), whose hard work shows in how deep he is willing to dive into the darkest corners of everyone we meet throughout his record of memories. the lonely, depressed, recently divorced plumber we are invited to connect with has a lot coming at him; having lost his brother to cardiac arrest, and now left to be the only one left to take in custody of his now fatherless nephew.​from watching the heartbreaking flashbacks that depict the uncertainty of the plumber’s path, to the humbling, somber performance by casey affleck (no tears necessary), all audiences suited for the well-earned r-rating will be greatly moved by its rough depiction of an everyday story within an everyday life.what makes the chilling power of this deceptively simple story so powerful is the consistently cold feel that lonergan maintains from start to finish. being set in the northeast, snow appears all over to reflect the plumber’s state of mind, and the cold is felt all the greater depending on the amount of stress tugging between him and his blood relatives. the screen’s empty starkness takes its time to linger on the quietest of moments, screaming the loudest of internal noises without saying a word.manchester by the sea could have easily taken place anywhere in the world, not necessarily in one particular small town in one particular part of the nation. what makes the boston-manchester setting work to its advantage is its subtle handling of the culture, right down to the look, feel, and taste of the area. the much-needed emphasis on father and son bonding through the quietness of fishing bookends the film with the one single image that defines everything valued by the people who live there. also similar to last year’s big oscar-winner spotlight, there is a clear presence of catholicism guiding the lives of all bostonians, whether or not they consider themselves religious. they claim that all catholics are christian, which is not believed to be entirely true by everyone, nor is it said so in the feature, but it works to the advantage of making the sense of hope they seek after touch much closer to home.there are plenty of independent features out there that tackle the discomforting subject of family death and custody, but none of them handle it with the same level of detail, humanity, and personal application as manchester by the sea. it’s not the feel-good holiday treat you may be looking for this time of year, but considering how family and tragedy essentially go hand-in-hand, lonergan’s scholarly study on the personal crisis will help countless others in what to do about a similar trauma.hence, i encourage all to see this masterful, humbling work when they get the chance to, but not just with anyone, with the relatives they are the closest to. that way, you can walk out of the theater together sharing the tears of your worst and best memories. if more movies had the power to do that, then hollywood would at last be restored to its former glory.","wait to see this film until you know you have nothing to do and nowhere to be afterwards, particularly if you've ever lost someone close.  an eloquent and profound observation of loss, love and life itself -- powerful in all the ways only intimate cinema can be.  stunning work from all involved.","if you love ""feel good"" movies, you might want to skip this one. there is no resolve or happy ending. this is the real, raw, and brutal reality of life after horrendous tragedy. kenneth longergan, the director and screenwriter, brilliantly articulates the void of life after insufferable and incurable tragedy. it may have been a crowd pleasure to write an ending where his nephew brings back the spark of life, but i found it more authentic to end it the way that kenneth did. casey affleck's character, lee, mentally imprisons himself for his past mistakes since the law will not do it for him. he deprives himself of every form of human connection or indulgence; going through the motions of life without fully living. this is a story of tragedy without healing. casey affleck's incredible ability to convey the long drawn affects of grief is oscar worthy.","it's a mystery what all of the hype is about... excruciatingly slow, bleak, boring characters and landscapes and about 45 mins. too long. if you enjoy watching someone take leftover pizza out of a fridge, put it in the microwave and watch it slowly turn, you might like this movie (this was an actual scene in the film - about 1-2 mins. long).","one of the worst movies ever made--boring, stupid, and flatline plot.  who cares about any of these characters?  dull, insipid, tired of limited vocabulary with f---.  don't waste time or money on this.",a 6 or 7 out of 10 at most.  a bunch of lame writing (affleck has to rush back to boston to his janitor's job rather than stay and raise his nephew) coupled with affleck's emotionally flat performance makes for a ho hum movie experience.  won the audience choice award at the film festival i was at where i had seen several films at just that festival that were much better.  baffled at the ratings.  just not that good.,"this is one of the most depressing movies i've ever watched.  well acted, but very, very, very slow, and dark and the opposite of uplifting.  it's a feel sad movie.  the emotional torture of dealing with horrible life tragedy is well represented, but watching it for two and a half hours is not fun, nor particularly illuminating.",a very depressing movie.you are pounded with f bombs throughout the movie.tries to manipulate you into accepting what you see is normal.i can't think of anything positive.,"this was one of the most honest, compelling, and beautiful movies that i have seen in all of 2016. kenneth lonergan has truly written and directed a masterpiece that will be admired for decades to come. casey affleck and michelle williams really shine, but every single performance is spectacular. every single actor completely transforms, and the honesty of this story left me feeling both full and hollow when i left the theater. this movie changed how i view grief, mourning, and masculinity. if you can only see one movie this 2016 oscar season, make it manchester by the sea. this movie changes the game.","a very depressing movie, not for me. good acting but i go to the movies to end up feeling good and this  movie had the opposite effect on me. the young actors were very good.","if you are looking to be entertained, stay as far away from this movie as you can. it is well-acted and directed but it is a bleak, depressing slice of life. i wish someone had clued me in beforehand as had i known, i would happily have given it a miss.","this is an extremely dark movie.  critics love it because it doesn’t go for the happy ending.  casey affleck will likely win an oscar for best actor.   affleck plays an average lower-middle working-class guy living in a small coastal fishing town.  michelle williams (who is probably too pretty to be believable for the part) plays his wife, and they have three young kids.  affleck is a happy guy with zero aspirations in life and spends his free time boating, drinking with his buddies and dabbling in recreational drugs.  the movie would have you believe that many people live this kind of life, and that most can get away with living a sloppy and ambitionless life without consequences but, in the dice game of life, affleck takes a stupid gamble and rolls snake eyes.  he becomes a haunted and angry individual who moves to boston and ekes out a living as a janitor.  several years later, his older brother dies and names affleck the guardian of his high-school age son.  this could have been a movie about redemption.  (it’s the obvious ending choice, and you will find yourself hoping for it, rooting for it.)  instead, you get a cautionary tale about broken people. those who like this movie use a lot of adjectives to describe it like: ""heartbreaking, genuine and powerful.""  it is all those things but, it’s also a movie without hope. the ending is sudden and abrupt like a cold slap in the face, a lump of coal in your christmas stocking, or discovering the grinch in your living room instead of santa claus. if you're looking for holiday cheer, you might want to go see something else.",i walked into this movie with all the hype in the back of my mind and no idea what the story was. i loved the cinematography - the acting was extraordinary but i found the storyline over the top and kind of overblown melodrama. what brought him to get so drunk? how did he survive the unsurvivable? i felt like they just kept adding reasons to not like lee (casey affleck) while feeling sympathetic to the two ex-wives. i feel like they just wanted to create a job-like character when in fact he is more of a self-destructive character. what brought him to drink and do drugs? also - although i love the music overall - the placement of the sound on one speaker over whelmed the dialog and the emotions of the scenes. anyway - great job by the actors - not so thrilled with the director or the writer's job. sorry - i left the theater feeling as if i was taken advantaged of.,"i can't believe viewers rated this movie highly. although decently acted with adequate cinematography, the story was unredeeming about a man who experienced a significant tragedy but who is given a chance to turn his life around by his older brother who makes him guardian to his son. the main character is inadequate in dealing with his loss and his opportunity and fails to honor his deceased brother's wishes. we are all familiar with people who are overwhelmed by life's circumstances. we go to the movies to see shining examples of people who surmount these challenges and point the way turning things around. this movie failed.","the film is pathetic. dragging on, pretending to portray real feelings, this film is neither real nor (good) fiction. it is sentimentality on its lowest level with no real educational sense either. as far as the script, in one instant, the creators didn't know how to get out of the drag, so they just turned the page, changed the music to a happy sound, just to fall right back into near senseless depression, and end the film on meaningless nothingness. how can other film critics not see the worthlessness of this 2.5 hour-waste-of-time? perhaps, they are afraid not to get free tickets next time around.","i so wanted to like this. there is much to like about the story but the editing combined with the director falling in love with the screenplay he wrote, turned it into a cliche of an art film. it is not gome baby gone that afleck did so well. definitely watch it, but on cable. it was so excrutiating at times, i so wanted to fast forward. keeping the camera rolling while nothing happens does not make it deep, it just makes it indulgent. every scene michelle williams is in is incredible. would she deserve a nomination... yes.","beyond salvation.  horrible, dreadful movie.  makes me want to cancel amazon and redbox.  depressing, and it never got better.  we kept thinking that perhaps the next scene would rescue the movie.  but alas, this was one of the worst movies we have ever seen.","dull boring, the tragedy is used to try to give the movie something interesting but it is stupid and unlikely. affleck acts like himself. why make a movie like this? critics are dopes.",manchester by the sea doesn't go anywhere.  i kept waiting for something profound to happen but it never did.  the movie is boring and i can't figure out why it won awards..... two thumbs down... booo,"i think some people didn't like this film because of ""silence"" and i usually am one of those people (for example, true detective season 2). but, here it adds to the film somehow. the film rarely deals with the normal confrontational way drama is presented. we often see the in between moments of the events, or the aftermath - and when paired with excellent acting this made it seem more genuine. there was something about the way it was written and the screenplay, that make the characters more real than those in most other films i've seen.","silence is often the most deafening sound.  a loss can trigger the strongest of emotions.  and there is nothing louder in this film than the quiet performances of its leads and virtually say everything especially in moments when no words are exchanged.  i watched this one as part of the london film festival 2016 and it blew me away for its equal measures of heart, houmor, love, despair and humanity.  the casting is superb and deserve to scoop up the awards of the year in a story which even though one can guess from the start what is in its nucleus, we sit and admire the masterful director peel it off to gradually reveal an even richer and more layered core."
Rosemary's Baby,"haunting, this film created mass paranoia in conspiracy and the occult. a brilliantly written and executed look into the secret and bizarre.","and the artistic thrills..rosemary's babythe stunning background score, witty horrific image and the nail-biting tense surrounding that is offered in here is easy to give one the anticipated chills and goosebumps that stays with one throughout the course of it. roman polanski's smart adaptation with perfect editing is something to explore in it as it demands attention from the first frame. his work on execution too, is appreciative if not completely justified considering the potential of the script. on performance, mia farrow grows on you as it ages on screen but unfortunately isn't supported well enough except for ruth gordon's stellar performance. rosemary's baby is a smart take on its genre, for it may go into places where one has been before but still doesn't use the clichéd formula like appalling creatures or hide and seek show or a typical altered ego.","again polanski and his greatness. so sick directing, so sick story, and sick acting. great movie to watch when you want to be paranoid.","roman polanski is a classic and his long career has consecrated him as one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century, although i don't have any sympathy for him as a person. this film is probably one of the most notorious and acclaimed of his career, and rightly so. when it debuted, in the late sixties, it was scary and i fully understand why. more than other horror movies so far, it used the permanent tension to keep the audience in absolute discomfort, not to mention that danger around a baby is something that touches the emotional side of anyone. it's something innate. the story takes place in an apartment building and revolves around rosemary, a young woman who impregnates after having had a mysterious nightmare, when something possessed her sexually. finally, other revelations, and the attitudes of a couple of elderly seemingly loving neighbors, convince her that she expects a son of the devil, the antichrist himself. terrifying, is not? with such a good script it was easy to succeed, especially when polanski so cleverly uses visual and sound effects as well as cinematography, misty and dense. everything was thoughtfully designed to make us tense. rape scenes are worthy of anthology. today, by themselves, they don't scare us, horror movies have been so full of gore and blood that these scenes have lost their strength, but if we embed them in the film, they contribute a lot to our discomfort. mia farrow was at the highest level during the film, perhaps the most controversial of her career, since neither her husband supported her. sidney blackmer and ruth gordon glared at the castevets, the movie's villains. john cassavetes is more restrained but does very well with his role. at present, this movie may not scare you as much as it scared you in the past, everything has its expiration date, but it remains one of the great classics of horror and must have a place on the shelf of any lover of this movie genre.","i had a really tough time getting into this movie. to the point where i found it just severely dragged at times and failing to keep my interest. don't get me wrong, farrow does a great job and i think the premise is interesting enough yet for some reason, this movie just didn't click with me.","overrated is one word that comes to mind.  quick info on me, i was born in '79 and i have never seen this film until today.  to say this is a ""horror"" film is a stretch and some critics have this film in the top horror films of all time, it's not.  the movie drags and is very boring, nothing really happens for most of the run time, 137min.  here is the other part that is kinda sick, there is basically a rape scene in the film and if you know anything about mr. polanski, well watching that part in 2019 was a little strange.  i think this is one of the films where if you mention it around other film lovers they will say how great it is, but if you were to really ask them about a certain scene (example the stupid ending)they would have no response because they probably have never watched it and just read a critics review in order to fit in.","rosemary's baby is a horror film made in 1968 and directed by roman polanski but whether it's a drama aswell as a horror i don't know however that would explain the slow acted pace and countless conversations in the film. mia farrow as rosemary was odd at times but i personally think she did a great job in her role and she's genuinely a great actress but there's a few problems with rosemary's baby. for starters you never see the baby or any baby but there's scenes where you know she's pregnant and what's going on and secondly the story makes no sense. another bad thing is the film has a rotten ending and makes little sense at all, the plots all over the place, some of the characters are weak and some of the acting is shabby. for a horror film to work you don't necessarily need blood and guts or a dude going round stabbing people but you do need something to grab the audience's attention and to shock or scare and rosemary's baby had nothing. rosemary's baby felt like a drama all the way through and nothing in the movie suggests it's a horror movie and at times it's very boring and mainly focuses on a plot against the baby which gets tedious and pointless conversations that never stop or stop and hop to some more dialog and conversations. there's no blood in rosemary's baby except for the death of some woman which is very little, no suspense, tension, no shocks, twists, nothing and certainly nothing scary about it because it feels like a long drama film mainly just consisting of conspiracy's or conspiracy theories and conversations after conversations. it's a long and tedious film at times and i wasn't impressed especially for a horror and this film is plain bad. not even mia farrow can save this in my eyes and roman polanski can't make horrors. simple as that and sadly rosemary's baby is a tragic film that is basically a road to nowhere. the films beautifully directed and some of it's enjoyable but it gets dull and overlong with very little to keep the viewer interested if anything only to throw down one of the worst and stupidest endings in movie history which disappoints and your left wondering is this the final climax i waited for? like i said, road to nowhere and personally this film is neither scary, terrifying or anything and can get boring.","the buildup of suspense and how the plot unfolds was perfected by polanski in rosemary's baby. this was even made better by the spectacular cast led by mia farrow and john cassavetes. definitely a classic horror masterpiece which obviously inspired some of our modern horror filmmakers like jordan peele, ari aster, and robert eggers.it's just frustrating that one of the best horror films was made by roman polanski.","el bebé de rosemary (1968)sinopsis:un matrimonio se instala en un apartamento de nueva york sin sospechar que sus vecinos pertenecen a una secta satánica. cuando rosemary queda embarazada, se aísla poco a poco y la verdad sobre su bebé es revelada después de tenerlo.opinión:una indiscutible obra maestra del horror psicológico que ha influenciado el cine moderno hasta nuestros días, está muy bien actuada, muy buena puesta en escena, buena dirección, atmósfera siniestra y eventualmente retorcida cocinada a fuego lento, un verdadero clásico.valoración:5 ⭐ de 5 ⭐","96% positive critics reviews and 8.2/10 average score from users - this must be the highest-rated horror film (true horror = supernatural, not including sci-fi 'horror')!however, 'rosemary's baby' (polanski, 1968) is terribly camp, hammy, and kitsch - even for the '60s. it really hasn't aged at all well - almost as bad as 'easy rider' (1969). mia farrow is good, but the other actors seem like they're making a completely different, surreal, psychedelic film.the plot is virtually non-existent for the 2 hour 17 minute duration, so it's empty, and the acting is often so hammy it just seems unbelievably creepy and weird, but not in a way beneficial to the film.when it comes to devil-baby films your go-to should always be 'the omen' (donner, 1976), and the sequels of the trilogy - the oscar-winning score from jerry goldsmith is truly disturbing.8.2/10 user review average?! if you're one of the average then i guess you're thinking, ""you just didn't get it"", but i got it - roman polanski was a creepy, weirdo, convicted child-rapist himself and thinks that's how normal people act. they do not. 2/10 - honestly.","few specials effects and scenaries, but the ever lasting legacy of this picture is it's acting.",it's actually such a classic horror movie and it's honestly a brilliant movie in general.,"one of the best horror movies i've ever seen. a dark, gloomy atmosphere enveloped everything. stress, creepy is what rosemary's baby is for",a masterpiece that has one of the most disturbing atmospheres that can be found in a movie and a very well structured terrifying story.,i finally saw full hd streaming from catshere is the site where i saw: fmovies21.org,90%—— classic polanski film. truly a great watch for a mind bending craving.,"of course ,it is very great film.i like polanski,he has made great films ,but this one always was considered as his best.so,i`m the one,who do not think like that.","por ser um filme de 1968 a gente releva muita coisa, mas é um filme muito bom para os padrões da época.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Maltese Falcon,"bogart is bluffing with such authenticity, he is deep and cannot be disenchanted; enters a lady with a tricky case.the maltese falconhuston is, as a storyteller, simply narrating. a lot of directors have come and gone, but none of them was just reading it to you, tucking you in, he whispers the book in his infamous adaptation like it is his, the director's, john huston. the story, if you are aware of it, has been wielded before too, but it didn't come out this durable and.. well, shiny. the narration is a bit tricky in here, since it is something that would- i wanna say be better if on paper, because it is and it was good- resist if exaggerated.the scenarios, the characters, the entire tone of this film-noir is bound within four walls. it ping-pongs here are there with ""he said. she said"" affair where as an audience you are in a rush to figure out what actually is going on or has been going on in this first act. after which the film reveals all its cards and we relaxed back in our seats, hoping for something ""bang!"" to go wrong. but it doesn't. this is where the film cheated me the most and left me in awe of it.for if i think about it i never wanted it to go wrong or right or in fact anywhere. huston's filmmaking is so present in that room where around three to four major characters are sitting around or roaming about that you don't want this day to end. anticipation is the game then, and the tease, is huston's key to success. watch how a simple phone call or a knock on the door pumps up your heartbeat fast, scared, hoping that it wouldn't collapse, ""the stuff that dreams are made of."" the maltese falcon is as good as any historic event, i say claim it history and be done with it.","i walked away from this movie feeling largely indifferent about it. i thought it ran a good 20 minutes too long, was slow-paced and failed to really capture me with its story.","this is probably one of the most compelling classics in noir movies. it is a style that even today has passionate and faithful followers, and sometimes reappears in cinema, whether in the form of simple tributes or even in the form of a kind of ""neo noir"" that we can see in films like ""shutter island"", ""the black dahlia"" or ""mulholland drive"".the story of this film revolves around a statuette of a falcon, made of gold and precious stones, an ancient artifact that an order of knights - which the film clarifies at the outset to be ""the knights templar of malta"" (i will talk about this later) - offers in the 16th century to emperor charles v in exchange for the mediterranean island of malta. according to the story of this film, the object was lost and never reaches the hands of the emperor. in this film its the search for the artifact that motivates a crime that is investigated by a detective, alongside the police.the biggest problem i had with this film lies in the historical premises on which the script was built. it may seem petty, but i am a historian and i value a certain historical rigour. that is why the expression ""knights templar of malta"" gives me chills of horror as it mixes and confuses two orders of cavalry that should not be confused. one is the order of the temple, or the knights templar, which has nothing to do with this film, and the other is the order of the hospital, or order of malta. the knights templar were founded after the conquest of jerusalem in 1099, at the end of the first crusade. the order became very rich, acquired land, prestige and power, aroused envy. persecuted by the french king philip iv, it was extinguished by pope clement v in 1312. the order of the knights of st. john, or knights hospitallers, was also founded after the conquest of jerusalem and also enriched but was never extinct and still exists today, with another name: sovereign and military order of malta. this is due to the fact that, when jerusalem was lost by the christians, the knights moved their headquarters to cyprus, then to the island of rhodes until, finally, they settled on malta in 1518. the island, then part of the territories of the crown of aragon, was ruled by the germanic emperor charles v, who was also the king of castile, leon and aragon (today spain), as charles i. calling templars to the hospitallers knights is, thus, a gross history error, almost like saying that lincoln founded the united states of america, or that napoleon i was the last king of france.the film is dominated by the presence of humphrey bogart. a great actor from the golden age, he is excellent and i just found it difficult to keep up with him when he accelerated his speech and ran over words, making it difficult to understand what he was saying. i also liked the performance of gladys george and mary astor, which surprises us in the end with an interesting but somewhat obvious twist. in turn, the character of peter lorre struck me as a bit of a caricature. the film has a lot of dialogue and it can be a bit boring, especially for those who expect a little action, but i handled it well except for bogart, as i said.technically, its a discreet but very competent film, with quality production values. it has excellent cinematography, with impeccable and original shooting angles and camera work. its relatively high contrast looks good on the screen and makes the film visually pleasing. the light and shadow effects and lighting are truly superb. the sets are routine but elegant, the costumes are excellent with all the raincoats and fedora hats we could wish for. of course, cigarettes and alcohol couldn't be missing, and i don't see any problem with that.","the stuff is dreams are made of...movie that's defines film-noir. all of it's there: cynical detective, femme fatale, light/dark contrast. and also one of the most regonizeble macguffin in movie history. humphrey bogart is amazing, the man that oozing with his charisma through the screen. bogart and huston just simply created a character that is all noir.i have to be honest, i didn't like it at first time, but giving it a thought it was really something... with my ""not liking it at the first time"" conflicting with my love for cinema i'm giving this picture only 7, even though deeply inside i know it deserves more...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12 Years a Slave,"chiwetel ejiofor is so impressive in this incredibly intense, visceral film.  (when it ended, nobody in my theater moved for a period of time, and there was no round of applause  mostly, it seemed, because of the shock of it all. clapping didn’t seem like the right thing to do.)  the fact that we experience the story from the perspective of a kidnapped free man makes the film instantly relatable.  i was so happy to have watched all of tom fontana’s excellent “copper” which features an african american civil war veteran doctor living in new york, and all of his family’s struggles in five points.  solomon, a new yorker kidnapped from washington dc, could be any of us.  the southern landscape as it likely existed in those days provides such a beautiful-yet- eerie backdrop to this movie.  what i particularly appreciate the fact that all the shots are confined  you never see very far into the distance. there’s never any perspective on things. when the boat transporting the kidnapped south moves, you see the paddlewheels. on the plantations, you see the three or four acres where the slaves live.  you never get any aerial shots, which is so effective in giving you a disoriented, lost feel.  even if solomon wants to escape, he has no idea where the hell he is, and neither do we.  the acting in general is uniformly excellent.  fassbender?  wow. not  since ralph fiennes in schindler’s list has an actor put out so completely for the detestable guy role and to such great effect.","beyond the intriguing premise (a man is kidnapped into slavery) this movie goes nowhere.  brutal, repetitive, and pointless.  what is the subtext?  what is the message?  slavery was bad?  no character development, no plot development.  just one graphic depiction of cruelty after another.  brad pitt's accent is ridiculous. compare this movie to schindler's list or even roots  and it pales in comparison. skip ""twelve years a slave"" and save yourself an extremely unpleasant 2 hours.","well, here comes the biggest oscar-fisher of the year. a totally unnecessary film with every star they could have possibly packed in there for exactly that purpose does nothing special with its characters or its plot (pun unintended). it's kind of entertaining, sure, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it again. it's just kind of there and a tad formulaic. it even feels a bit exploitative (it's a film about life in slavery with an astonishing number of recognizable names in it, but no one who really *fits* into the role. ""dirty pretty things"" portrayed a few similar themes *far* better, and the protagonist was even likable. can we ever get a slavery-victim role that portrays a realistic human, and not just stereotypes of what we were taught in elementary school?) in its portrayal of the time period, and takes the ""drama"" genre to the breaking point.","only went to see movie cause wife wanted to.  so many stereotypes, excessive brutality and sadism without sufficient redeeming purpose.  it's a significant story historically but uncreative, humdrum approach to the subject.  acting of main character is excellent but even then it doesn't feel true  feels like a movie made for some ""noble"" purpose.  i prefer django unchained because at least it doesn't try to pretend to be something it isn't.","this film is a true eye opener to the very wicked past of the human race. i am delighted that we no longer live in this type of society. this film is fantastic, great acting and full of emotions. buy it!!",this film clearly showed those bloody times. great story and great acting. 9/10,this is one the best movies i have seen this year.  i thought the movie did not pander to our  at least mine  common thoughts about slavery.  chiwetel ejiofor is a wonderful actor and did a very good job here.,"i cried...several times. i think it is very appropriate to start my review by saying those words. in an age where showing our emotion in public is apparently a taboo. needless to say, apart from a few heartless sods, i was not the only one who left the local theatre wiping tears from my cheeks. putting it simply, 12 years a slave is superb. the way i see it, this should become the staple period-piece film. it is a film that shows us a dark, visceral story of a point in time that the american government would much rather sweep under the rug. it is a triumphant story of loss and despair, but also of remarkable perseverance and resolve.the simplicity of the plot leaves the weight of its success on the individual scenes and phenomenal writing. the great cast and setting meld together perfectly. in a year of phenomenal films, 12 years a slave comes out on par with many others, if not slightly above.i hope that in a few years, this might be the film that is shown in history classes. it is not something that should be watched for the sake of the film, it is something that has to be watched because of the horrific times which its characters live in. a 10 out of 10. jack valentine","i was extremely tired and sleepy when i decided to watch de movie. when i finished, the last thing on my mind was my bed. the amazing job of steve mcqueen on making the film the most shocking as possible attached me to the screen from the beginning to the end of the story.","the film 12 years a slave is a modern day masterpiece. reasons include:- superbly acted- exquisitely written- beautifully shot- masterfully directedthis movie is the total package. i highly recommend seeing it.","a must see film!  one of the best historical films to date.  outstanding performances all around and amazing special effects.  there were a few people that walked out during some scenes, what a shame!","""12 years a slave"" is beautifully written with well crafted performances from the actors and actresses bringing the script to life. the film is brilliant and powerful, reminding audiences what this nation was built upon and how it shaped the course of history. some scenes in the film was so painful to watch, it was hard to look at the screen. the performances of each actors from chiwetel ejiofor, paul giamatti, michael fassbender and lupita nyong'o was so moving and believable that audiences can feel every bit of the suffering, loss and despair the characters they portrayed. this is definitely going to be the movie to remember of the year and easily a contender for best picture, directing and cast.","the actors in this film did their job to a t.  i felt the director filmed the rape and sex scenes tastefully where they did not take away story.  yes, rape is not tasteful. but, instead of me sitting crying in pain for the victim, i was crying for the overall plight of victim.  rape was just one layer of the violation she had to endure. the overall view of slavery seem tame compared to the reading of slave journals. this movie has violence.  oh, yes violence.  but, the roots tv series seemed more violent than this movie.  also, the northern states relationships of white and blacks seemed to have a 'modern' take in my opinion. in the end, this movie was very good.  i was wept, prayed and hated for 2 hours.  a wonderful exercise of the emotional senses.","haven't seen all of the year's ""best"" yet, but cannot imagine that i will see a film better than this one. although grim and hard to watch at times, it affected me deeply with its combination of intensely awful actions and intensely beautiful cinematography. chiwitel ejiofor's performance is stunning. perhaps the one ""off"" note was brad pitt's turn as the low-key guy who saunters in and acts as savior  but i guess somebody had to do it.","12 years a slave is a gripping engrossing film about the era of slavery in america, and how being a free man doesn't matter to slave traders and owners. chiwetel ejiofor deserves an oscar nod for his stunning performance, and many other contenders are in this as well. this movie was realistic and engaging at every second. even the dramatic pauses were worthwhile and definitely not a waste of time. the script inferred and hinted at events rather than just plain saying them, and that was genius. overall, this movie makes you think about morals and ethics of humans. i can't fathom how slave owners could be so ruthless and passive about the whipping, selling, labor, etc. that the slaves had to go through. it's films like these that'll make this part of history never repeat itself again.","the film's raw textures and brutal imagery fit mcqueen's proverbial bill; the only thing more transcendent than the film's story are the acting performances that make it so much more hard-hitting. it's not for the faint of heart, and it wastes very little time getting into detail. if you are familiar with mcqueen's other outings, you can imagine that a historical film about slavery won't be all peaches and cream, which some people (clearly) have a hard time digesting. and that's okay, but this is a responsible, balanced film that deserves anyone and everyone's due diligence to view it from the perspective of a historian and not a critic. the statement it makes is going to be there - no matter what - for a movie about slavery. instead of getting hung up on this notion, immerse yourself in the film and give it every last bit of attention you can give; it's not worth wasting your time otherwise.","excellent visuals and a strength of resisting the urge to squeeze modern politics into this classic tale brings it to the top of 2013. this story is one that may be difficult to watch if you are squeemish and want some superhero to fly in and carry them all away. it is important though, and gives a well rounded view of the times. it also holds back on the stereotypes that plague almost every other movie on this subject matter. home run.","a great, great film about a free man who is abducted and sold into slavery. it is a very sad tale and shows how racist we used to be and how bad slavery really was. a great cast with many great acting performances. michael fassbenders character was crazy and he did a fantastic job with his role. a great movie deserving of the best picture oscar this year.","this film makes the shawshank redemption look like king arthur. never have i been stunned into an emotional silence after watching a film in the theater. literally. never. i've come out of films before thinking ""my god, that was unbelievable"", like when i saw the lord of the rings for the first time, but this film just hits you on another level entirely. you sit there after its over, wondering if what you'd just experienced was real. the day after, you feel the same. it's like seeing your favourite band live - you have trouble believing it at the time, and you still have trouble believing you ever saw them a week after. one of the most vivid depictions of slavery ever put to film with phenomenal performances from ejiofor and nyong'o, but the real stand out performance here is michael fassbender. combined with excellent cinematography from sean bobbitt, a very tight script by john ridley, excellent direction by steve mcqueen, beautiful editing by joe walker and a great score by hans zimmer that greatly marries modern orchestral work with contemporary music, serving to underscore the emotions of the film rather than intrude into the film's actual story. while it may not be a film that you can watch repeatedly - i think everyone needs to see this film at least once. a very, very important film.","'12 years a slave' amazes with its attention to detail and authenticity regarding the lives led by slaves. it was well researched and refrained from creating drama to add spice. from the very first scene, mcqueen wastes no time in plunging us into the daily, ordinary lives of black slaves of the nineteenth century deep south. interlaced with the present story that we're being shown where the protagonist, solomon northup (chiwetel ejiofor), is already a slave, a series of flashbacks flesh out his previous life as a free man in the north. he has a wife and kids, and leads a normal life just like the white people who surround him. he is introduced to people who promise him good income as a violinist in the capital. he agrees and leaves his family behind in new york for an intended period of two weeks. he is lulled into a false sense of security and drinks more than he should have. when he wakes up he finds himself in chains confronted by men who insist on calling him a slave. i got the impression that those of the african extraction who were born free are inherently different from those who were born into slavery. they think and speak freely and have a different view to life. those who were born into slavery seem to have embraced their fate. there was an interesting scene where a slave walks into a shop and stares in amazement at northup when he was a free man in new york. paul giamatti plays a slave-trader who has them stand naked as potential customers roam about and inspect them before making a purchase. he divides children from their mothers without a second thought. it is here that ford (benedict cumberbatch) buys northup. mcqueen doesn't take it easy on the children we have seen just because we might have developed sympathy for them, for to do so would be a gross betrayal to the ones whose stories no one narrated and their anguish never revealed, and to keep them safe would suggest that this was the norm where in reality it might have been an exception. john tibeats (paul dano) comes across as someone who never might have thought about the ethics of slavery once in his life. he is instantly recognizable. there are a lot of people like him who go about their lives without letting their thoughts stray into areas that demand serious discussions like philosophy, the arts, poverty, war etc. they came into this world to lead their lives like sheep, eating well, wearing and spending extravagantly, and having a general good time. if they were picked up and dropped into a time when slavery was legal, they would not once flinch or utter a word against it as long as they belonged to the group that was doing the slaving. tibeats resents the fact that ford has grown fond of northup, and the latter's quick wit and high words offend him. northup's next owner, edwin epps (michael fassbender), puts him to picking cotton in the fields with his other slaves. he derives his own interpretations from the bible sanctioning slavery, and lashes them accordingly. sometimes he has them brought into the house in the middle of the night and dance around. epps's wife is jealous of a slave girl and abuses her constantly. she can't seem to grasp the fact that if her husband paid special attention to a slave, it was his fault and not the latter's. she constantly threatens the slaves and taunts her husband to be more tough on them to keep them in line. when she offers them respite, she expects gratitude. husband and wife bring the worst out of each other. but epps is the epitome of psychopathy. he bullies with his every word. it is a constant struggle for northup not to incite anger and have his master lunge at him with murderous intention. deaths among the slaves happen without any alarm being raised. some of the black people have had it easy on them courtesy of their owners. they even had servants and slaves serving them in a few cases. northup becomes a part of the community, but he still tries to reach his family and friends somehow to inform them about his situation. he trusts in someone who betrays him, and barely escapes death. northup is finally able to reunite with his family, but not before we witness possibly some of the worst scenes of barbarity displayed anywhere on film. at moments the score is so quiet it's almost imperceptible, but complements the scenes perfectly. the production design and costume design paints a vivid picture of the time. there's a simplicity and mundaneness to everything from the way the slaves toil everyday to their time spent privately. the film was edited with ingenuity. both narratives develop side by side and complement each other. instead of a beginning where we might have wondered when northup was going to be banged up, we see him as a slave from the very first shot. and the flashbacks only come when they are relevant to the present story. northup's character development was palpable and poignant. mcqueen has promoted himself to the a-list with this masterpiece of the highest order.","this is breathtakingly well made with top notch performances up and down the cast, but without a doubt the toughest film to watch of the year.  the horrific things done to these people and the way steve mcqueen unflinchingly shows them makes this a must see at least once.  a","12 years a slave is a gripping engrossing film about the era of slavery in america, and how being a free man doesn't matter to slave traders and owners. chiwetel ejiofor deserves an oscar

african-american people experienced during the u.s.'s years of black oppression. the acting is astounding, story unexpected (likely, considering the movie is an adaptation of a true story) and all in all the film comes out leaving you speechless with any peer you may or may not view the film with. this is an utterly exceptional movie that gives you possibly the best and most accurate film adaptation of slave life.  this movie will, without a doubt, stay in my eyes as one of the most powerful movies i've ever seen.","this review of “twelve years a slave” is late in coming since i, like many others, was reluctant to see it because of its raw and powerful displays of brutality. after all, the film experience should be pleasurable and something to enjoy. nevertheless, i took the opportunity to view the film on a dvd a friend generously loaned to us. as i watched the film my concerns were indeed realized for some of the scenes were certainly uncomfortable to watch. however it was worth the 10 or 15 total minutes of discomfort to be able to be artistically exhilarated as we saw inhumanity and dignity oppose each other in what was the then mentality and norm of the slave genre and the society that embraced it. the acting of chiwitel ejifor, the writing of john ridley and the direction of steve mcqueen make this a rewarding theatrical experience which the viewer will find difficult to forget or even equal. the film tells the true story of solomon northup, a cultured and well respected african american northerner, who is kidnapped and then sold into slavery by his abductors and ends up spending 12 years on one or more southern plantations. it’s easy for an audience member, black or white, to identify with the lead character and that is what makes the film work so well.  massive suffering among thousands is a broad and almost meaningless phrase when compared to describing the plight of one individual. it is something the viewer can more readily identify with and understand. i give this film a 9. to those who may still be reluctant to see it, think of it as historical medicine. it will enrich your minds and help us understand even more the oppression and bigotry that once infected our nation.","12 years a slave is probably the film that portrayed more accurately the subjet of slavery.  compare it with django unchained is nonsense, because the goal of tarantino was show and evaluate vengeance in the hands of a slave. in contrast 12 years a slave seeks to exhibit the life of slaves, seeming more a documentary that a fiction movie. that is why the idea is not to feel sorry for the protagonist or to cheer for him, it is simply to learn about this topic and do not forget of what we did in the past. the only problem of this film is lack of message, besides showing what was slavery and that is not escape from it, there is not much below. although if mcqueen wanted to have something below, it would not be possible to make the movie like a documentary. despite all that mcqueen gives us an excellent job, the script is also very good, the cast is amazing, specially ejiofor, fassbender and cumberbatch, but lupita nyong'o surprised me a lot.","blown away by this film. absolutely blown away! i was expecting a slow and sappy story, but it's intense. the acting, especially a particular scene towards the end, is phenomenal. micheal fassbender deserves best supporting actor over jared leto (and yes, i have seen dallas buyers club). in 10 years, this movie will end up on afi's top 100 movies and will probably be at least top 50. it's that good. i warning you though, there are some tough scenes to watch. you may need a tissue box.","incredible film. steve mcqueen displays proficiency as a filmmaker in this masterfully crafted and brutal look at slavery. chiwetel ejiofor gives one of the most compelling performances in cinema history, giving a multi-layered portrayal of the daily horrors suffered by his character. other performances from michael fassbender and lupita nyong'o deserve recognition for the amount of sophistication brought to these roles. not to mention that the cinematography and sets for this film were amazing. this is a movie that deserves to be seen, and is easily the best so far this year.","12 years a slave was a brilliant film. the film was so well done the acting was great the directing was great,  the story was interesting and in intense scenes the tension was held brilliantly. it is overall a great film 10/10","this is easily one of the greatest films i've ever seen, and in my eyes competes for my personal number 1, which is the shawshank redemption. 12 years a slave follows the incredible story of solomon northup as he is torn away from his free life and family, and forced into slavery. the entire film is a cinematic masterpiece, and will leave you in silence upon finishing it, simply due to the realism and shock of it all. steve mcqueen has taken this true story and provided it with complete justice in a movie form, and he had no intentions of making light scenes. each and every scene of this movie is full of emotion and the actors/actresses portray their feelings outstandingly well, i'd be very surprised if chiwetel ejiofor didn't win an award for playing the role of solomon northup. unlike typical movies which are full of soundtracks and constantly changing scenes flashing before your eyes, this movie sets a very silent and extended form of scenery. there are moments in the film where all you are seeing is solomon's face with nothing but silence, and it causes you to really read and understand the emotion in his face. the brutal scenes in which the slave's 'masters' are punishing them are also extremely powerful, and you as the audience are forced to witness prolonged scenes of horrific torture, the reality of it really does hit you hard. what i like about this film is the way it focuses so closely upon a handful of characters. the scope of the scenes never goes beyond solomon, or the cotton farm in which the majority of the film is set in. by following the characters so closely, and portraying their emotions throughout, you develop an extremely sympathetic bond with the solomon and his co-slaves, which very few movies i've seen can do. if you are reading this and haven't seen 12 years a slave, you must see it. the film does take a bit of stomach to watch, and you should also be prepared for the shock and reality of it, but in my eyes it is a must see. personally, i think this is the sort of film which will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time, and the ending (which i wont spoil) is particularly moving. 10/10 for me, and i'm very picky about movies.","probably the most powerful film i've ever seen. the directing is absolutely spot on and the acting is world class. i can't really say too much about this film because i don't want to ruin it, but anyone who wants to watch it i highly recommend it. i can tell this is a film which we'll all still be talking about in 10-20 years time.","there is very little i can say about this film that hasn't already been said: the acting is easily the best of this year, maybe even of the last decade, the story is effectively gut & heart-wrenching, and steven mcqueen brings just the right amount of visual panache and gritty realism to do the story justice. i cried. i cried every time i saw it. it's about time american cinema stopped being afraid of our history with slavery. and while that description isn't perfect (steve mcqueen is british, after all), it definitely signals a huge step in the right direction. there are demons everywhere, and this film is unafraid to throw its main character into the heart of darkness northup actually experienced. it may be hard to stomach at times, but every american (at least) should see this movie. it is a masterpiece.","had to write a riposte to the handful of reviewers leaving very low scores for this movie. one man's food and all that aside, the performances, script and cinematography couldn't possibly warrant such critical reviews. one reviewer (englishrose),  sees the movie as  presenting a challenge to criticise it or (sic - and) be condemned a racist, and lambasts mcqueen for  gratuitous violence. this misses the point. the violence is indeed brutal, and the threat of it, at least, relentless, but not without reason. it is necessary in portraying the barbaric nature of the antebellum slavery in its attempts to dehumanise a people. the reviewer complains that the film plunges too quickly into the risky details, but we learn enough about solomon to establish the character pre his ordeal. condensing twelve years of slavery into a couple of hours requires keen editing. besides, the reviewer's sense of time is a bit dubious in remembering a beating scene as twenty minutes long, which was in fact only several minutes. the director is censured by these reviewers for its oversimplified depiction of of white men as  evil and black as good, but the reality is far more complex. the story is not so much a collective disparaging of white people as a sobering tale of the cruelty all people are capable of when the law approbates their behaviour. there are questions as to why solomon doesn't attempt an earlier escape, but these simply aren't grounded in reality. when the likelyhood of successful emancipation is so small and the punishments for failed attempts so horrific, it does not take a great leap of imagination to see why so few slaves/captives make a genuine bid for freedom. the film will no doubt leave viewers with different feelings, but sanctimoniousness is unlikely to be one of them.","the film is lengthy and it did lose me about halfway/three-fourths of the way win but when it had me it had me by the balls. at its best this film is amazing providing one of the most engaging, emotional, and powerful films to come out this year. this movie is a must watch for any film buff. filmmaking can be an art and with some excellent cinematography you can create some powerful moments and this film does that.","it takes an emotional toll to watch steve mcqueen’s poignant 2013 best picture winner of the academy awards, adapted from the autobiography of solomon northup, a free black man is sold into slavery for 12 years in the antebellum united states. as the third feature film from uk auteur steve mcqueen (after hunger 2008, 7/10 and shame 2011, 9/10), 12 years a slave is a metamorphic achievement for his director competence, comes to grips with the grave source material, and transposes the text into a visually stupefying and inwardly resounding piece of cinematic treasure, compels audience to vicariously undergo the trials and tribulations of solomon (ejiofor) and his fellow black slaves, and to corroborate us the price of freedom is hard-won merely 150 years ago, we might say we have far progressed above the stupidity and narrow-mindedness portrays among the white folks in the film, and slavery is rather an antiquated concept, however, whether this self-aware moral improvement has reached its end of line, or 150 years later, when we our progeny harks back, we will be plainly as anachronistic as those pathetic, barbarous and abominable predecessors. i digress too far, but i do intend to reiterate the value of this film, not because slavery is obsolete so we contemporaries have no urgency to watch it, in fact, we are in absolute obligation to reflect on those historic iniquity to alert ourselves not to recommit the same error, which we may agree, a large portion of people are treading the same water in the present climate. now, back to the film, mcqueen and his team, in particular the long-time dp sean bobbitt, are luxuriating in their meticulous composition of each shot, the long-shot of solomon hung on a tree struggling to life with his toes tipped on the ground while no one care or dare to set him loose (in the background, several slave kids frolicking around) is strikingly daunting to behold, whether white or black, their mentality is ingrainedly impaired; intermittently, the breathtakingly picturesque topographic shots of the southern land (the bayou, the cotton field or the windy woods) seamlessly transition the chronicle into another twist or perturbation. the central dramatis personae is electrifying to the core, ejiofor whole-heartedly radiates in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and every single take lingers on his bubble-eyed physiognomy is unimpeachably soul-stirring, his immaculate dedication oozes solomon’s despair, angst and persistence. fassbender, mcqueen’s fixed leading man, lends himself to the meaty villain role, the outright racist plantation owner edwin epps,the dichotomy of his libido-driven infatuation with the young slave girl patsey (nyong’o) and the iron-clad truth she will never be completely his possession, is the centrepiece which culminates in an appalling whipping sequence where mcqueen unbendingly fixates on patsey’s heartbreaking wail and the horrid lacerations, nyong’o is no doubt meritorious for her oscar-win with her debut, her final scene when seeing off solomon to his freedom with both yearning (for herself) and felicity (for him) has been encapsulated with pitch perfect verisimilitude. further on, besides those three oscar-nominated lucky ones, it is a handful of under-praised but equally memorable performances, sarah paulson (mistress epps), alfre woodard (mistress shaw) and adepero oduye (eliza) all steal the limelight when their meagre screen-time is on, paulson is brilliant with her glacial frigidity and sharp callousness, woodard nails the most ambiguous role in the film with her composed utterance and oduye brings about a burst of volcanic theatricality in her tête-à-tête with ejiofor. by contrast, the other male side players are less prominent, pitt is the ultimate messiah for solomon, but reservedly underlit, and paul dano is on the verge of being typecast as someone either compulsively creepy or maddening annoying. john ridley’s stern screenplay (the third oscar win for the film) prunes the prolonged odyssey into a number of key chapters, carves out a clarified narrative arc while enlivening the jaded souls with terse lines full of understated connotations; hans zimmer’s score mingles with the movie’s awe-inspiring presentation of a history should never be forgotten, tallies with the credence of viewers’ spontaneity, unobtrusive, but superbly competent alongside this epic voyage, if you can stick to the very end, it is a film can sublimate your moral sentience, and steve mcqueen is a filmic wizard of sublime gravitas, at the age of 45, we can optimistically hope that his best has yet to come.","es casi una obra maestra, mi unica critica negativa es en los momentos largos de secuencia que muestrael sufrimiento y algunas escenas que pueden volverse muy tediosas.","filming harrowing memories of solomon northup. it really happened. the year is 1841. in the north of the united states for years blacks citizens enjoy freedom. however, in the southern states there is still slavery. based in washington, dc solomon northup  a free and educated black man, father of two children, happy husband and a respected citizen  is a trick kidnapped and sold to slave traders. film sensational.","a shockingly heartbreaking recreation of a true event in the bleak history of nineteenth century american society, mcqueen brings this period piece to life, or deprivation thereof, with talented cast performances on both sides of the divide. soloman northup, a free african american, is lured by two circus men who promise him work as a musician. however, his whole world is turned upside down when he wakes up in shackles and on the wrong end of the black slave trade. not a movie for the light-hearted, it features various scenes of black people being tortured, whipped, raped, and forced to stand still with no clothes on while they are inspected and sold off for a price to their new white masters (the proceeds of which they will never see a dime of). the depressing storyline aside, the film emanates with flowing nineteenth century frocks and settings, but it is chiwetel ejiofor as a brilliant solo piece that completes the film. we follow him throughout his 12 years as a slave, and his tight-lipped performance brews an emotional storm of helplessness but also hope in those who watch it. not being able to speak out much, especially in the company of his various overseers, leaves a lot of work to his body language, and he makes it work. i didn't find lupita nyong'o as impressive as the academy did, and brad pitt was inserted in seemingly because he just looks good and wanted to be in his own production. i guess we all would if we had the chance. it's an honest film, worth seeing even if just to experience what it means to be free one day and bound and helpless the next.","i just finished viewing 12 years a slave, and i have to say the movie was very compelling, and it donned on me that although they talk about the underground railroad during black history (mostly in february for those that don't get this information or just footnoted in certain schools), they don't talk much if at all about human trafficking of african american during the time of slavery, which if even 10% of this account of solomon northup is true is astonishing to me. how is this man not a celebrated hero (not just african american but of all americans in general). a lot of critics that i have read said that brad pitt's role as bass in the film was very small. i completely disagree, he greatly shows the contrast and contradiction in the failed logic of slavery, and the dehumanization of it. he's one of the few white men with great conviction and honor in the film since he is based of an actual person i guess in real life too. although is on screen time was very short is impact was great. what the film really does is show the plight of people (both black and white) during this time. although clearly the slaves get the worst end of it. it was indeed solomon northup's story, but it show's white southerner in circumstances that are beyond their control due to their station, and as much as some would like to change things they simply can't because the system set forth is too great. this is manifested in several different ways, and the actors did an amazing job portraying there frustration for the situation they found themselves in. mentally what the slaves had to endure, is completely unfathomable, this is apparent in several scenes throughout the film, just to endure the situations they are put in, it's clear they have to detach themselves and do the most unspeakable things to survive. eliza whom you meet in the beginning of the film, and mistress shaw are great examples. to me this is america, this is what this country was built on, there are several ideal that still hold true today, as convoluted and as sick as they were then. this is an amazing film i would suggest people go see it. warning, there are scenes that are really tough to watch, but don't turn away. chiwetel ejilor, lupita nyong'o, michael fassbender, benedict cumberbatch, sarah paulson, paul dano, brad pitt, all have standout performances.","12 years a slave showed us one of the ugly page of american history, and does so realistically with high degree of drama. acting as well as writing in this movie is oscar worthy! but it's not perfect, some scenes are better be cut off, some characters are pointless! overall  it's great but depressing picture",this movie should be shown in schools. this movie can teach and explain better than any other movie has ever. it really hits it out of the park. a great performance all around and my favorite movie of the year so far.,"wildly ambitious but restrained, 12 years a slave is an absolutely astonishing accomplishment. that rare mainstream work that draws us in through a character's strict pov but makes a huge statement and while examining a system of slavery built on torture, brutality and greed. 12 years a slave is a major work that should be required viewing for all human beings. it's that good.","this is a a very we'll done movie. has a lot of good actors, they fit the characters perfectly. also it being a true movie makes it a good movie for the whole family. but i'd say 14+ with adult supervision.","this is a movie after the book with the same name by solomon northup  it is a story of a free black man from new york state who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. this is a great movie, intense and very well done. plenty of graphic and cruel details which would make it hard to watch for some. but we have to know our history. the movie is somewhat un-even, some scenes are better than others. so, i do not give it 10 but 9 out of 10. this is one of the best movies of the year so far.","harrowing, grotesque, earnest, and featuring perfect performances from ejiofor, fassbender, and nyong'o, steve mcqueen's ""12 years a slave"" is an unwaveringly powerful look at the darkest depth of humanity.","it's always interesting to see a movie based on real events. some of them are breathtaking, so it is but in a heart-wrecking way. it is not like someone who lost at sea for months or someone who trapped on an island for years. it is slavery, very cruel and harsh form of torture that takes one's freedom away. this true story occurred back in 1841, nearly 170 years ago. a new yorker solomon northup, a born-free black american was kidnapped and sold into slavery. so his journey into the dark world begins after he was assigned to work in various fields. it was incredible and unbelievable sad journey of those 12 years till he gets his freedom back. after the movie 'shame' steve mcqueen retained his favourite actor michale fassbender to play in a prominent role for the third time for this historical epic drama. as usual, he became the ambassador to mcqueen's movie along with great performance by chiwetel ejiofor. the movie was captured in beautiful places of louisiana. the unknown supporting cast was also given great support with their small roles in the story. it was a good adaptation, but dialogues were very weak. there's no strong lines said anywhere in the movie or any memorable and rememberable. i believed the movie transformed exactly as the book says, i mean the original edition one. this movie is not appreciable for its contents because it was evilfull, but for bringing back the truth to the todays audience. it was acknowledgeable hard work for the cast and crew. so this movie will be recognised in big stages that mean the oscar is not far away to fetch for mcqueen and chiwetel.","a masterpiece. this movie is an affirmation of the power that can come from oppression, as well as to possess the power of resolve and determination.  it represents a major part of the american experience.","this movie is the best of 2013, (while gravity is my favorite), this movie deserves best picture oscar, the acting is great, chiwetel ejiofor was great, and michael fassbender is great, now some people complain that the movie is brutal, and that's how it's meant to be, because that's how slavery was in real life, and this movie perfectly captures that emotion, that's why it is a masterpiece, and why it deserves the oscar.","according to solomon northup's ""twelve years a slave,"" he tells a true story about a free black man was bondage for twelve years. steve mcqueen (""hunger"" and ""shame"") has directed his true masterpiece of an african american citizen from saratoga, new york was kidnapped by two strangers and he was forced into slavery from 1841 through 1853. chiwetel ejiofor, who portrays as solomon northup, plays a wonderful performance and the cast did an excellent job including, michael fassbender, benedict cumberbatch, and brad pitt. mr. mcqueen shows the entire film of taking back in time of where solomon northup was kept in slavery with possible events like he has to command orders by working, he needs to survive while he's on control, and he stands himself to face opportunity for becoming a slave. this film is amazing true event about a free black man was bondage in twelve years. it's a powerful, emotional, and gripping movie i ever seen and it's one of the best year's of 2013! thanks to steve mcqueen for creating an inspiring movie and it tells a great message about a survival became slavery for his past journey.","despite a melodramatic hans zimmer score, the worst kind of hollywood fanfare imaginable for this tender piece of cinema, mcqueen elegantly crafts 12 years a slave. his camera floats through fields of cotton like a ghost, lingers on the edge in wide shots as death hangs in the air, or races from character to character as intensity builds and blood flows from the backs of the innocent. his impulse is to move in towards ejiofor's tearful eyes, reflecting action through a lens rather that simply showing it for  gratuitous pleasure. there's much of solomon's predicament that mcqueen's film never quite penetrates, classist issues and relationships formed while surviving plantation life. but as an exercise in emotion, 12 years a slave is unflinching and artful. it's the closest we'll come to living out and feeling this tragedy. director steve mcqueen's eye is better than his sense of pacing in the nevertheless devastating drama 12 years a slave, featuring a standout performance from serenity's chiwetel ejiofor.","absolutely great film. chiwetel ejiofor's performance as solomon northup is absolutely oscar-worthy, as is steve mcqueen's direction. the film is emotional, dark, and depressing, everything that you would expect in a film on this topic. with 12 years a slave, we are presented a tragically true story and given every gory detail, making this film extremelty uncomfortable to watch, but yet, it's massively important."
Killer of Sheep," i really wanted to like this movie. i didn't. it is mostly dull with a few interesting moments. perhaps this film presents an exotic landscape to those who have never been poor and lived in bad urban areas. i couldn't help feeling like the kid i met on a dusty andean road when i was in south america. when i said ""what a view"" about the incredible mountains in front of us, he turned, looked and then turned back to me with a quizzical look. ""where?"" he said. it was nothing special to him. film criticism must pay better than i thought.","despite its grainy black and white, its art-house camera-work and its cool music, there is one huge problem: it's unwatchable, due to writing and acting shortfalls.","just as ""the velvet underground & nico"" spurred wannabe musicians to actually go forth with their dreams, ""killer of sheep"" opened up the door to independent filmmaking to anyone with a camera and the vision. as a film, the 'story' relies on a series of episodic scenes (accompanied by an incredible soundtrack) to depict poverty in the watts ghetto. this is both the film's greatest strength and weakness, because even though the neorealist style forces the viewer to experience the hardships with authentic intimacy, the lack of character development or plot makes the impression somewhat empty, (though not without a profound effect)",this movie goes no where. there is no sense of plot. nothing happens. feels like a student movie that a bunch of film students decided to hold in high acclaim b/c when & how cheaply it was made. i felt nothing.,"look at all those critics getting off on the importance of this movie. did they forget the point of movies themselves? this was garbage, from start to finish. pure garbage.","around the seventies, when films like annie hall, star wars, close encounters of the third kind, and saturday night fever ruled the age, charles burnett silently crafted killer of sheep, his thesis film for ucla. thirty years it has eluded us"," i was fortunate enough to catch wind of this unexpectedly provocative tale of arfican-american life in late 70's watts at the nuart theater in los angeles. this movie, as cast member charles bracy put it, is a true independent in that it really has no plot. this is a pure street movie aimed at telling the harrowing reality of african-american life on a minute-by-minute basis through the back alleys and residential avenues of watts, california. in the same vein of dark days, the viewer is turned on to more than he could ever imagine, cast into a whirlwind of emotions concerning the, often overlooked, subjects of the movie. a joy to watch."," a beautiful film - i loved it when i saw it for the first time 10 years ago. please, do yourself a favor and see this on the big screen. it's really amazing, comparable to early jamusch's work. also good is to sleep with anger, burnett's major motion picture starring danny glover.",glad to see that this great film is getting a proper release. i cannot wait to replace my old copy. hopefully more burnett releases will soon follow.," while the film has interesting ideas and images it really comes across as a mish-mash of story elements without any structure. the film is overrated. not horribly so, but it is not as good as people say it is. if you like experimental film then this might be a good one for you but those who prefer a traditional narrative form will not be pleased. really, i can only recommend this for its glimpses at impoverished african-americans in the 1970s. this is a first film and it shows.","i dont get all the fuss about this one- and i do enjoy quirky, indie movies.i fast-forwarded through a good bit of it. just nothing happening. yes, its about poverty, but what was the point of all of it except watching poor people living their lives? as another reviewer said ""i felt nothing"". i kept asking myself ""what is the point of this?"" i was certainly hoping for much, much more! so then i thought ""well maybe the shorts on the dvd are the gems""... uh... no-im sorry but i really felt the whole thing (shorts included) were stupid. and i kind of feel bad saying that b/c i know this guy was a student at the time and maybe im missing something? no. i dont think i missed anything. wasnt anything there worth seeing."," i only made it through about 15 to 20 minutes of this film. the dialogue is difficult to understand and next to nothing happens. i have read reviews that call this movie art - i can accept that. but do not call this movie entertaining, because it is not.",maybe if someone feels really guilty that america can produce a ghetto like watts then that someone would feel that this movie is worth watching. but that someone would also have no idea what makes a movie worthwhile.,"i get that this movie is a quiet serious look at poverty and all that, but in the end it is just plain boring. i don't mind slow paced movies, but this is too much, heavy handed and bad.","after watching this movie twice, i have concluded that (1) the emperor wears no clothes and (2) if you think highly of this movie, you are pretentious.  please, be honest for a moment.  you read all the critical acclaim this movie has garnered (it's the only reason you saw it in the first place) and you don't want to seem like the person that ""doesn't get it.""  permit me to help you feel better about yourself:  this movie was unwatchably bad.  you know it; i know it; and now i give you license to be truthful.imagine for a moment if this movie was filmed in color.  the ""artsy"" feel is instantly removed.  all that is left is intolerably bad acting and no story.  people have written that this movie has a nontraditional storyline.  if you want a nontraditional story of life in an impoverished neighborhood, drive to an impoverished neighborhood and hang out for a while.  you would never do this for two reasons:  it's a stupid idea and you would be insanely pretentious to do this.  that's all this movie has to offer.",killer of sheep is lovable and a legendary film of 2007. this movie is standing just right where we would normally have one of the best films of the year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nashville,"i have no idea how it's possible to fully flesh out all of these characters in a film with such a free-roaming plot. i also have absolutely no clue how every plot-line that concerns a specific character, or a specific group of characters, kinda intertwined, or rather formed altogether a complete (and very impactful) picture by the end.it took me some time to get invested, but once i found an interesting character, i gradually became fully immersed in what was going on. also, i have to admit that i wasn't constantly, or equally, engaged with each story-line, but that will definitely change upon rewatch.the songs are some of the best i've ever heard in a film. the well-deserved oscar-winning song ,""i'm easy"" is simply brilliant! it's quite a refreshing experience to listen to songs played out in such a free-wheeling manner.the performances are splendidly genuine. and you can't help relating to all of the (many) main characters when the film get to the personal dramas and moments of revelation by its second half.yes, i wasn't wrong when i said in my m*a*s*h review that i think altman's other films will work for me pretty well, and here he has made a kaleidoscope of cynicism, wit and intimacy: he has made a sprawling mosaic of american society in a most effortless efficiency!(8.5/10)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ratatouille,"this movie hits an excellent balance of humor and emotion. remy is a great protagonist, the kitchen staff is fun, and the critic has the single best monologue of any character in any pixar film. the movie isn't perfect, but it is definitely good enough to earn a 10/10; the slower moments are made up for by the quality of the rest of the film.","out of all 12 pixar films, ratatouille has to be the finest if only because it is one of the most visually stunning movies ever made. while other films try to show off the majestic look of paris (midnight in paris, taken and monte carlo) they never really succeed and its odd that the film that finally pulls it off isn't even live action. if anything ratatouille is the most grown up of the pixar fold (even up) with the story being remarkably layered and engrossing. sure the beginning is a bit slow but the slow build works because when remy finally crawls out upon the magnificent vista that is paris the film takes flight. it is a fast paced story of a rat named remy (voiced by patton oswald) who has always wanted to be a chef despite his obvious limitations he finally gets that chance thanks to an inept yet lovable human named linguini (lou romano). there are some truly stunning parts of ratatouille but you i won't ruin them because they really are fantastic. of course it is a film for both child and adult as every other pixar film but the thing that holds it up above all the others is the fact that the film builds as it goes. unlike up which has a brilliant opening sequence but doesn't live up to it, ratatouille gets better as it goes with one moment near the end with peter o'toole's ego being a brilliant piece of film despite the fact there are absolutely no words spoken. it is a classic film that gave me lots to think about after i watched it and even more after i watched it again. a real masterpiece.","in my opinion, the greatest animated film of all time, and one of the greatest all-around films of all time. it's perfect."," it seems so sad that some of the the fan written reviews written on this site are below the score of a 10. this movie is so appealing to the eye and has such a wonderful story that i do not understand the horrible reviews the fans have been giving it? are you all just trying to be different because everyone seems to like the movie and you have some kind of problem with an animated pixar film? suffice it to say, whomever have scored this movie in the yellow or red are officially morons.","not my favorite movie, but it has great entertainment, great writing, and most of all: great animation. rating: 85%",this is one of pixar's best movies yet. remy the rat wants to become a chef and his dream comes true when he accidentally ends up in paris and and discovers a 5-star restaurant.,"ratatouille has more life, meaning and intelligence then almost every film out there. pixar has always done a fantastic job of reaching out to children, while drawing adults in and ratatouille is no exception.","simple and genius in one pot. good example of flawless quality of pixar movies. good for any ages, almost 2 hours of good laugh and relaxing watching guaranteed.","even though it's rated g, this film has such an adult way of playing out and is very sophisticated. it is a melting pot of a movie. you get a little bit of french cooking, the secret ways of how a restaurant operates, you get a feel for 1930's paris, and most importantly you feel the clique between linguine and collette. all of these elements come together in one helluva movie.","this one of the reasons pixar is great.they can make anyone or anything lovable. evan if it is a rat. remmy is a good black sheep,and every time  i watch this movie it makes me hungry.","this is the best animated movie i have ever see, ideal for kids. fantastic and fabulous are the only words i can say. entertainment + emotions + inspiration + soothing music = ratatouille best i've seen so far!"," this is a pixar film that really appeals to both children and adults. the beautiful animation, the humor, the look inside a french restaurant kitchen are for the grown-ups. and there's also plenty of silliness and excitement for the kids. and this animated paris is breathtaking - i wanted to jump right on a plane.","its very very difficult to get food appetizing in a cartoon and the animators did a great job in this movie. i enjoyed the culture of the film but the overall story was a little too predictable and standard, perhaps the movie needed more laughs. it's not pixars best but ratatouille was a fun and worth while animated movie.","this movie is the start of a flawless four film streak by pixar from 2007's ratatouille to 2010's toy story 3. this one is one the especially strong pixar efforts in terms of comedy. there's also a pure artistic appeal to the whole film, wether it's the animation itself, the french sets or the whole animated city of paris, this movie seems like one of the most delicately executed and thought out  films of 2007","ratatouille is funny, original, heartfelt, well voice acted and beautifully animated. as pixar makes more and more movies they make just fantastic films like ratatouille. i give this film 96%.","let me just say that i hate and have no respect for patton oswalt whatsoever for reasons i'd rather not discuss. but watching this movie, i could easily forget he's the voice of remy, becuase i loved everything about this movie. as always pixar, great job!","best pixar film? maybe, best 2007 film? definitely!! ratatouille is a masterpiece that everyone will love. the characters, the humor, the memorable moments and basically everything in this movie is exellent. a delicious buffet.note: sorry for my english, im from costa rica."," another wonderous achivement from pixar that marks a major return to from after last year's 'cars' came up short. a rich blend of comedy and pathos. technically accomplished and visually stunning at times, 'ratatouille' never forgets it's a story first and foremost. bird and co. have lavished just as much attention to the script as they did the animation. the very reason pixar is so far ahead of the pack."," the fact that a 3-year-old, a 6-year-old, and three adults can sit for two hours and be mesmerized by this wonderful movie says it all. each pixar movie gets better. this one is the best. nothing was trite, nothing was too hip to keep it from being timeless, and nothing was formulaic other than the mild relationship to ""ben and me"". just when you thought it was over, you say, ""wait; what about ego the food critique?"". and so it goes. animation was magical and spectacular, and the character development was first-rate. i have already reserved a copy for me and for my grandkids from amazon when its out for distribution."," this movie was a total delight, from start to finish. unlike most ""children's"" movies, there was no annoying sidekick character playing the buffoon; the humor was wonderful--both kids and adults were hooting all around me; and the art of it was unbelievable--scratches on the copper pots, bubbles in the soup, realistic details everywhere. and in paris, i enjoyed the ""special"" details cleverly tucked into the background--the ""no smoking"" poster in french, the traffic, the bateaux mouches, the notre dame rose window. i have loved movies my entire life, and this one is clearly in my favorite top 10!","not an animated film, a great movie. well written, funny, well directed. this is what movies are all about."," while children will doubtless find this entertaining, there are much deeper issues permeating the latest pixar masterpiece. this is a film speaking directly to the adults in the audience while keeping the children occupied. the clumsy surface antics and clever dialogue will keep people in stitches while bird and company tell a story about art, passion, and what drives people to create in the face of adversity. it's about following dreams, heeding the heart, and how perseverance can lead to triumph. told and presented in a flawless technical skill, through characters and situations only pixar could deliver. this is a form of perfection, and do not deny yourself the experience.",one of the best pixar films ever made. beautiful to behold; it's a masterpiece.,"very good, but a little too sweet for my liking.","watching it gets me hungry, and it has its  fun moments and great appeal. if you don't like it, thats just shocking then. because this is the best pixar film by far","""ratatouille"" is a movie created for only the westerners and ends up appealing to both western and eastern people.","i really didn't enjoy this film, i'm a bit disappointed actually. i was looking forward to seeing it, i mean, the advert was quite good. but after watching the film i realised that the bits that were in the advert were the only good bits in the film, and that's not that many.","""ratatouille"" is a classic pixar animation and a fantastic accomplishment. the animation is brilliant (as usual), it's well-directed, the script is intelligent and is consistently humorous. pixar movies are textbook examples on how to make films for both kids and adults."," i can't believe this movie got 96 when i feel a sleep because i was so bored. this movie was supposed to be better then all the pirates, transformers, and lord of the rings. no way! 6th best movie ever. metacritic is unreliable and has low movie ratings for all teen movies and good ratings for all adult movies and boring kids movies!","this movie is really outstanding! the graphics were excellent, the theme is great, the plot is mesmerizing, the characters were amazing. everything in this film were fantastic. this is a true masterpiece...","simply one of the best movies of 2007!one word for this movie: amazing"," beautifully animated, poorly written. some of the most uncomfortable, cliched, awkward script moments ever. the movie seemed to try to go in two different directions and failed to give the audience a sense of completeness. was it about linguini's romantic struggle? or was it about a rat who could cook? i had to dull out my brain in order to bear some of the inconsistencies in the movie. i am not surprised this movie got high ratings however. these days people will take anything shiny and distracting.","good ideas. visually excellent. but not very funny. and worst : again and again in an us movie about france, the action is in the present, but the paris you see is like the 60's. black and white tv, cars of 60's... i was disappointed."," the best part of this movie is its soundtrack--and it's not even a musical. the score is the only element with range (ooooh and every transition is seamless!), while the characters are underdeveloped and (...wait for it...wait for it...) flavorless--ha!, and the colors are as dazzling as the arc de triomphe in fog. hell, even janeane garofalo manages total insipidity! her covert vocals are wondrous to be sure, but only magnify that colette (a fair-weather feminist) does nothing to jazz up her wet noodle, linguini (yukyuk), who in turn gives the evil ego less than zilch to bounce off of. now, please don't think me hard-hearted. i am a vegan who's been madly in love with three people, angus, matty and pouter--a scotch terrier and two cats. nothing makes me happier than to see animated creatures with personalities, facial tics and accents just as disparate and human as their real-life inspirations. oooooh, inspiration...where's that on the menu?"," there are moments in ""ratatouille"" that works on us in a primal way, like ego who remembers the titular dish that his mother served him as a child. the pompous critic remembers why he loves food, as this dazzling comedy(you forget you're watching an animated picture) reminds us why we love the movies. ""ratatouille"" is so sophisticated, there's an extra tier of sophistication that will fly under the radar of most moviegoers. ""ratatouille"", to my utter disbelief, has references to the canadian filmmaker atom egoyan and his film ""felicia's journey"". ian holm, who voices the role of skinner, the chef in exile, was in egoyan's ""the sweet hereafter"". this is such tremendous fun for cineastes because we can't understand why it's there in the first place. this piece of trivia is irrelevant to enjoying ""ratatouille"", but the references are there, nevertheless. in an ordinary film, it's linguini(voiced by lou romano) who'd be delusional(that a rat is actually doing the cooking), but in ""ratatouille"", it's the delusion(from skinner's point-of-view(he's the first person to see the rat); skinner, who reminds me of that single person who sees the duck in those aflac commercials) who has delusions(chef gusteau is remy's muse). ""ratatouille"" also has references to carol emschwiller's novel ""the mount"" and gary larson's ""the far side"". and if you remember ralph fiennes' wine cellar speech to embeth davidtz in ""schindler's list"", ""ratatouille"" can be interpreted as a fantastical parable that sutures the rift between jews and germans. ""ratatouille"" is a truly extraordinary movie that makes you laugh, cry, and most importantly, think. this is pixar's high-water mark, and that's really saying something."," a fabulous movie. i took my daughter and was amazed. i love to cook and the film captured the rapture of cooking, paris and well rapture. i loved the visual and musical depictions of flavour which reminded me of old canadian national film board cartoons. it was a fantastic movie.",ridiculously good. i liked it better than both the incredibles and cars.,we did not like this movie- visually impressive but should have been a 5-10 minute cartoon.,"it was miserable, how could it get a 96, it was terrible.",this movie just aint that good. it kinda bored me!," how can u be so stupid (or, poopid) , metacritic?

here goes! 1) i hate it when a movie establishes it's time period and then throws in anachronisms that make your mind go, ""huh?"" for example, t's set in the '50's so how could gusteau's be selling microwave dinners? and a major plot point is solved with dna profiling? 2) the kid - whatever his name was - looks to be all of 10 years old and then we're supposed to a romantic subplot with him and the severe french chick? kinda felt gross to me. 3) one too many villians. it's as if pixar was trying to stuff as many evil plot twists into this script as possible and there was no focus. 4) how the rat - whatever his name was - comes to communicate and control the kid's bodily function is entirely ludacriss and makes no sense. i can suspend my disbelief with no problem but this ""human steamshovel"" idea was way too weak. 5) when it comes down to it, no matter how cute you try to make them look seeing hundreds of rats scamper on stage and especially watching them take over the kitchen and cook is more sickening than cute. the audience i saw the movie with was creeped out, the kids were restless for 3/4 of it and many kids were yelling, ""i wanna go home"". some families left but i like a fool just sat there and said, ""this is the worst cgi/annimated film in many years! a 95 rating? folks, look closer and don't be carried away by the phsical beauty of the film. it's very, very poorly written!"," the animation was great. the story, pretty good. the movie is definitely better then 'cars' where i was bored to tears. this is the third pixar movie in a row, however, where i can't help but looking at my watch and wonder when it will be over. the ending is predictable. i think pixar needs to worry about becoming too formulaic. just because pixar changes from the sea, to the racetrack, now to the french kitchen, does not mean all these moves are incredibly original. in my opinion, they are the same story over and over again. of course, maybe i was expecting something dramatically different due to the 95! overall score...",sorry but the movie is poor. certainly i would not recommend this film for kids. although the scrip is original the movie is predictable and the end is poor, yawn. advanced technology isn't enough to hold a movie together. this movie lacks true creativity. it's a perfect example of how lame and unimaginative mainstream movie-making has become. and the rave reviews by the critics illustrate how they're completely fooled by big production that has no soul.,"i could barely watch the whole thing. boring, repetitive, completely devoid of humor. not exactly atrocious in any way, just dull and unfunny."," a very mediocre movie and overrated movie. almost all of it's humour is jerry-lewis-esque --- ie strange bodily contortions, (when the chef is throwing his arms around) or funny faces pulled during various scenes. if you like that sort of thing, or indeed if you find jerry lewis funny, fine. i found it puerile,and i suspect most adults would. the thing is, it does have some truly beautiful imagery -- ie the scenes of paris at night -- and some really nice music. but this is a comedy. it's nice to look at and listen to, but as a comedy, it fails. it's just not funny. not to mention the characters are tired modern stereotypes -- the hopeless, sappy nerdish male, and the confident, successful,powerful female who loves him in spite of himself. for christ's sake, writers, half of your audience is male. stop alienating us. bottom line - young children will probably enjoy it. adults best avoid it.", i can't believe this is on the top ten of all time list. yes the animation is phenomenal but i wouldn't even rate it in the top ten of pixar releases (including shorts) let alone any best ever list. the storyline and characterisation are very poor and as for humour... was there any? just average.," quite honestly, i'm amazed and disappointed that this film is rated as highly as it is. nearly every part of rattatouille has been recycled from past pixar films. sure, the animation looks great... in fact visually, rattatouille is beautiful. but shouldn't we be interested in telling a story, not showing a tech demo? or is our society so bland and unintelligent that we find a mouse learning to cook more entertaining than the lord of the rings trilogy?"," great fx. lame story. i mean, why do these pixar films sell so well and get good reviews? this was a clunky who cares type story where the main character was an idiot, and the rat was not much better. i get the point and understand the story, just seems like it could have been an after school special made for disney kids. just because they spend multi-million dollars on a film and the cgi sets the standard - i just don't get why our culture enjoys a movie about a french cooking rat over movies like rescue dawn or other ""real"" heartfelt films that actually take more than the actor coming into the studio for a day to voice over. the new beowulf is another example of this. all it is is eye candy, and the story and character development seems to be fading with our short attention spans."
Parasite,"to sum this movie it up, it is a black comedy, a thriller, a horror and a social satire in 2 hours. seems like a lot in 2 hours, but not only is the message of class division clear, bong presents it in the most accessible and humorous way while being able to shock his viewer; and everything from the performance of the cast, to the script, to the cinematography and to the production is flawless and jaw dropping.calling it a great movie is an understatement. bong has created a masterpiece and what could possibly his best film so far. go watch the movie as soon as possible. if you love cinema, this is one movie you have to watch. it will leave you speechless at the end.","absolutely magnificent movie from a great great filmmaker that always send the audience to a place that could just say: ""wow, whatafuq...!""","parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it’s not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. i have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. the film’s message is a little on the nose but i don’t have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. other than that, this film is perfect. there is not one bad performance in the movie. cho yeo-jeong, park so-dam, and kang-ho song are standouts from the film. all 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. another aspect i loved was the cinematography. the film’s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. the film’s story and themes make this film incredible. the story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. it’s so incredibly tense. you never know what is going to happen next and it’s always surprising to see what eventually happens. the film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. the rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. another thing i liked about the film was the score by jung jaeil. his score adds so much more to the tension. i know i’m using the word tension a lot but that’s what this film is. a constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. for me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. one final aspect i want to touch on is the humor. most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, i do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. except this film to be on a bunch of top 10 lists at the end of the year. overall, parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",it’s never less than interesting and watchable but in the end for me there are so many better korean movies that it doesn’t live up to the hype of my expectations.,"i wasn't sure what i would find with parasite beyond the expectations i had for the excellent reviews it has received so far.but if i should emphasize something about it is its unpredictability in a story that thematically emanates an amazing dramatic darkness and at the same time manages to balance it with a touch of black comedy and certain elements of a mystery thriller.parasite is a film completely controlled and designed to be unraveled delicately while you consume its social commentary and understand both sides of the social spectrums of both families and the ending leaves a bitter lesson and yet nothing lacking reality.you will talk about it quite a bit after finishing itparasite is the kind of cinema that is always welcome and always necessary.disturbing, dramatic, funny and unpredictable: a triumph.","in “parasite,” writer/director bong joon ho continues his critique of capitalist economies that, in his judgment, inevitably create economic divides resulting in class warfare.  in his earlier films “okja” (2017) and “snowpiercer” (2013), bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  with “parasite,” he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.setting his story in seoul, bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  south korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world – 96% of the population is korean.bong’s pacing of his story is impeccable.  in act one, we are introduced to the kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  when workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  “it’s free extermination.”  at the other end of the economic spectrum is the park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.when a wealthy friend of the kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the park daughter, the kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the park household.  so far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  this tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  remarking on the parks’ unlined faces, mr. kim intones: “money is like an iron.  it smooths the creases out.”in act two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the kims’ actions on one of the displaced workers.  by the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (mr. park observes that those who ride on the subway have a “special smell”) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  for me, bong’s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.“parasite” won the top prize at this year’s cannes film festival and is south korea’s entry for best international feature film at the oscars.  it’s one of the finest films of the year.","here it is.my favorite movie from asian cinema this year.good acting,good script and a good directing... thank you bong joon-ho",such a good movie. probably one of the best films ever created. takes you on a roller coaster of emotions,"um dos melhores filmes desse século até o momento, sem dúvidas! apenas assistam e procurem saber o menos possível para terem uma experiência surreal de vida.","this is a korean film that i can't quite categorize! i don't know whether to consider it a comedy, drama, thriller, dark comedy, etc., as it contains so many elements of all these genres. one thing i do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! winner of the palme d'or (the french equivalent of an academy award) earlier this year at the cannes film festival, this film follows a poor korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. they seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. and to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time! really, all i can say is this: no other film this year had me laughing so much during one moment, and then completely on the edge of my seat during another, with certain scenes even leaving me absolutely breathless and speechless! the acting, writing, and dialogue were all so brilliant and razor-sharp as well! the film is layered with so many unexpected twists and turns! i never knew where this film was going or what it'd morph or evolve into next, as each scene and moment always felt so radically different and unpredictable than the last! on top of all that, the film undeniably provides a unique subtext on class, social status, the lengths some will go to for prosperity, and how people within certain classes are often perceived. overall, i can't even begin to heap enough praise towards this masterpiece of a film! it had just about everything to offer, combined so many favorite elements and genres of mine, and left me flabbergasted by the end to the point where i sat through the entire credits and then some in order to properly process and sit with what i'd just watched! this is far and out one of the best films of the year, maybe even the decade!","the biggest surprise of the year. i went to watch the movie without knowing very well what i was going to find, and i left delighted. the artistic direction is 10/10, and the mix of drama, comedy and thriller make the two hours and peak that the movie lasts by flying. totally recommended.","this movie was really good.the cinematography was incredible and every shot that was filmed was done so masterfully.the film also does great with mixing comedy,tragedy and suspenfullness.i  have barely watched any korean movies(except train to busan) but i can  see that koreans are making really good movies so i will have to keep an eye on their movies since they really do emotional movies great.","parasite is satirical, but it's not meant to make you laugh hysterically. it's more sophisticated than that. it takes some unexpected turns that kept it interesting throughout. there is a turning point in the film when everything clearly starts heading towards a chaotic finish, and it delivered well.","i think my life is like that, it was a very deep and content film, thank you.","well...this film is almost a masterpiece, for its genre. visually stunning, brilliant acting, amazing direction by bong joon ho, and a captivating story drive this film to incredible heights. i’m never too keen on foreign-language films as i can’t really understand them even with the captions, but this just glorified them. the only thing i’d say about this film that doesn’t really drive the movie down for me is the pacing was a tad slow, but that would be me nitpicking for any mistakes. overall, one of 2019’s best for sure.","a totally unexpected movie, left me disturbed. it's so good that it feels kind of unreal to be created in 2019. masterpiece & best one of the year.","i usually don't watch movies, my attention span is simply just too short for so many of them. its for that sole reason i stick mainly to just thrillers and suspense, productions that will keep me at the edge of my seat. and oh boy parasite does not disappoint in that aspect in any way whatsoever. its a movie full of twists, one wont know what hit 'em..","this movie was amazing!!! this is the latest movie from south korean director bong joon-ho, director of the host, okja, snowpiercer and more. this is only the second movie of his that i have seen and it really makes me want to watch more! this movie is about a poor family who all get jobs working for a rich family as part of a scheme, and it just gets crazier from there. the performances are excellent, the story is interesting, it looks beautiful, it has comedy, it has suspense, it has horror, it has romance, it has everything! my only complaints are that the movie is a little slow in the first act and that sometimes the dialogue went by too fast for me to read the subtitles. this is good writing, and i feel like i missed some of it. i’m a pretty slow reader though, so your experience may differ. and yeah, the movie is presented in its original language and subtitled. if that’s an issue for you, don’t see it. you won’t enjoy it. otherwise, if you want an exciting and well-made movie that is completely original, go see this movie! it’s one of the best of the year!","definitely worth watching and for my opinion the best foreign film of the year,","incrível, fenomenal, sucesso total. uma verdediera obra de 2019, filme traz toda uma relevância para o debate atual sobre qualidade de vida, desigualdade social, luta de classes, violência.","this movie has a little something for everyone; comedy, drama, thriller. a full palette of emotions, masterful cinematography and an immersive and believable story. i'd recommend this to anyone who is willing to anyone who is willing to watch a movie with subtitles. one of the best films i've seen all year.","you know a movie's good when you wind up having a dream about it. the last movie that affected me that way was akira kurosawa's ran. the latest to affect me that way is bong joon ho's parasite. the only other movie i've seen from bong is snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. the actors all do a superb job, especially kang ho-song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. the writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of ""planning"" and pessimistic impracticality of ""dreaming"", in a hard-hitting way. this movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.the cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. the way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. no wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. the score stands out too. at times it gets super eerie and spacy and combined with the imagery, it helps produce the feeling that you are in a fever dream, and trust me, when the sh*t hits the fan in this, it's a fever dream and then some. i highly recommend this hard-hitting bit of cinema.",i rarely log in to write a review.this move made me instantly log in to post one.,"a great film that deserved to win the palme d’or at cannes. in a strange way, it’s a korean version of upstairs, downstairs, but much more cutthroat and much more fun. you never quite know what will happen next with such wily servants and such clueless and pampered rich people.","parasite is funny and clever at the same time. through trickster reality, plot is developed under a lot of intelligence and it's almost impossible doesn't hold yourself until movie's end. probably this year's best movie.","dissecting the struggle between the classes through the lens of innate human nature -- regardless of class status -- provides the foundation for this rip-roaring black comedy/social satire, one of those rare films that grabs your attention and holds it from start to finish without letting go. building on themes explored in such previous works as ""snowpiercer,"" writer-director bong joon ho serves up a riveting, ruthless offering that makes its point clearly but without being heavy-handed or cartoonishly over the top. in doing so, the filmmaker dishes out a wealth of utterly hilarious humor about subjects that ultimately prove to be no laughing matter. easily one of the year's best, sufficiently award-worthy in many respects, especially in its superb writing, the fine performances of its excellent ensemble cast and a thought-provoking message that should give us all a lot to think about.","easily the best movie of 2019. a great movie, it entertains, it thrills and it shocks, thanks to a perfect direction by bong and some incredible performances from the cast.","from south korea, the movie that will be the worst nightmare of almodovar and scorsese. dark comedy, drama and suspense in the vein of hitchcock are mixed masterly in the story for a family of phonies and his dastardly art of getting away with it, or almost. unexpected twists and an unpredictable end will make this one be tattoed in the memory of viewer. rush!","mind-parasitizing!one of the most exquisitely directed, and well-crafted, films of the decade. give joon-ho bong an oscar from now! (8.5/10)","parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. director bong joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. over the course of parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. just when your investment in the characters peaks, bong joon-ho takes parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019.",parasite is one the best movies i have watched hands down! highly recommended,"amazing film.  authentic, real, and a story i have never seen put to film before.  highly recommend.  10/10",the movie is the best of the year.there will always be movies like this befitting oscar,"i think a ten film is one that you enjoy in the moment, but it stays with you after. i’ll be thinking about this movie for days and will continue to get more out of it as i do so. i thought i would be let down after all they hype and this is not the case. my only complaint is that it does feel a little long at points, although i don’t know what they could have cut.",film bluffant à voir quelque soit vos goûts cinématographiques évolution scénaristique très intéressante je trouve,"bong jon-ho and the rest of korean cinema is giving hollywood a run for its money, and this film is a proof of that. the fact that western audiences praises this flick like its the second coming is a little too much. yes, it is highly original, and yes, it shifts its tone from broad comedy to thriller with incredible ease, but korean cinema has been doing that for the last 2 decades or so. if it takes this flick for film fans to be aware of this incredible film industry, then so be it.","i saw this movie for the third time now. i'm still trying to think of a movie that's better than this one and coming up short. the first ever non-english spoken movie that won the best movie oscar, simply because it was the best movie. it's an amazing story with a twist and an ending that i really didn't see coming. a drama/comedy balance with social commentary that works surprisingly well. the acting is simply great and i think it'll be a while before something better comes to the big screen. it's just really, really good, even after seeing it three times i still love every second of it.","an incredible story of a poor family who scams their way into working for a rich family, each taking on a separate role. the movie moves forward and becomes more intense as each moment occurs, culminating in a finish that is thrilling. a fantastic movie that feels fresh and full of new thoughts and ideas even 2 hours in.",i think the best thing i can say about this movie is how well everything blends together. bong has truly crafted a film that fires on all cylinders and that alone makes me highly recommend watching it.,"i saw bong joon-ho's the host and i can see he brings many of the same themes (poverty, classism, codependent family relationships) in his latest movie parasite. what starts as an endearing tale of a crooked family drama (which gets a bit long in the tooth) takes a hard right into 'lets see how long they can play hide and seek in the house' all the way to 'metaphorical homeless guy lives in the basement and worships the upperclass homeowner'.... so not very subtle writing here! still the cast are superb here and the cinematography was slightly above average. my only wish is that the screenplay held back from it's flights of fancy long enough for us to enjoy the wonderful texture of that first 30 mins. a decent watch overall.","an instant classic that keeps you hooked from beginning to end. it is easy to watch, but deep and ambiguous at the same time, with outstanding performances and excelent direction by bong joon ho.","el guión es impresionante, como puede generar entramados de historias, tantos círculos conectados. desde la familia por un lado, desde la ciudad por otro. desde el hogar, desde la calle. desde el suelo, desde la tierra. desde los parásitos y los parasitados. hay muchos binomios","perfeito, o melhor filme do ano e não tem discussão. direção, roteiro e montagem no máximo. bong joon-ho está em outro nível.","parasite is one of the most perfect movies released in recent years. with its impecable directing and great performances, it delivers a darkly funny, often awkwardly haunting tale that touches on themes of class devide while never forgetting to be first and foremost a very enjoyable thriller.","i have never cared about acollades. i never watch a film because it has won a golden globe or listen to a specific album because it has won 3 grammys. but this time it has been different. when i saw the huge amount of academy awards ""parasite"" was recieving, i felt the immediate need to see it. and i won't ever regret it.""parasite"", directed by bong joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. it just has everything. the title is also magnificent. it makes you think that you'll see south korea battling against ""coronavirus"" but no; you'll watch a capturing movie where the word ""parasite"" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn't fit in, that does not belong here nor isn't welcomed.this film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect. my congartulations to the actors and director who made me cry of joy and of sadness and have made me see how this world is a beautiful mess.","parasite, bong joon-ho's recent satire of the social class division in south korea is nothing short of incredible. the film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a family living in the poor areas of seoul (im assuming). after the son ki-woo (choi woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an english tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly ki-woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of robert eggers's 'the lighthouse'.after contemplating the events that took place witin the film, it seems obvious to me that like jb priestley's 'an inspector calls', bong joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.as for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly park so-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a best supporting actress nomination. other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that i feel there isn't much to talk about.parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently i absolutely recommend it.fun fact: elon musk officially stated that parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him.",it is an art and full of mysteries that will always keep you busy wondering what will happen next. no cliches or any nonsense. straight story telling and great acting. the director is really good.,"the film made me feel different things while watching it, like anguish, anger, fear and even joy. it is amazing how the film can change so much from beginning to end without realizing it, and when we notice it, we are already very euphoric waiting for future events. the film is full of super well done scenes. it is usually a discreet angle of the camera that gives us the view of grandeur or claustrophobia. the perfect montage along with the soundtrack, which causes us a lot of anxiety and magnifies the main characters' wooden face, or a big turnaround in the script, containing once again, a montage, soundtrack and performances collaborating so that the scene is quite harmonious . i never thought i'd be in any doubt if i hoped someone would do well or badly in the story. i loved the experience, i loved the film and the social criticism it proposes about class difference, showing in a very discreet way the privileges of some and the lack of privileges of others. parasite (gisaengchung), for sure, is one of the best films i've ever seen.","now it's the time to stop that longing, parasite was just flashed me through my mind and filled that completion of my waiting. since it was released, it was talked, it was going for awards and it created a history in academy awards i was so far and keen to watch this movie and it veils the curtain now. as a movie, it is worth watching because i'm not used to the socio-political aspects of korean culture. the film describes the class variations and social norm dividing people into rich and poor. but actually what makes me attractive is that kind comic blending at the beginning by the family to enter into the park mansion. going smoothly, sometimes it provides a little bit tense and frights the film has a steady graph till the end and then it hype accidentally and i feel astonished. the mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. a very changing pattern of korean society and korean classification was the major essence that i can find in the movie.","solid 10. during the entire movie you will be anxious to find out what happens next. it has a lot if symbolism regarding the movie’s main theme. for a movie that is meant to be so dark, it is quite humorous at times, it’s part of what makes the movie so great.those who rated this movie with a bad score or didn’t like it should just stick to watching the pile of trash being pushed out by marvel (like deadpool). if you’re into that kind of garbage, this is probably not the movie for you."
