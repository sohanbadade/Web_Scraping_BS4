Near Perfection!,Black Panther is likely Marvel's most politically inspired film to date.,"Believe the hype: This is a superhero flick unlike any we've ever seen, crafted by the unstoppable Ryan Coogler.","Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight.",Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.,"It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma.","Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]","Does ""Black Panther"" occasionally fall into predictable superhero traps? Yes. But it also feels like the work of a filmmaker with a specific vision, one he more or less executes.","Groundbreaking? No doubt. An absolute unmitigated triumph? Time will tell, but from where I stand, not quite.","Black Panther is one of the best steps forward for the MCU in many ways: In story, characters, cinematography, its combination of score and music. Basically its whole package. It is one of the strongest and most inspiring films in the entire franchise.","It is not the best superhero movie that boast around so much, but it is one where you can have a good time. [Full review in Spanish]","Black Panther may be long over due, but there was nothing about this film that didn't feel less than exactly what it should have or could have been.","Boseman has such charisma, charm, depth and grace, it's as easy to believe him as a king as it is to see him do insane acrobatics as a superhero.",They really took care with the story.,It had a lot of heart and it was really fun.,"Each man and woman...is resplendent in Ruth Carter's traditional costumes. Indigenous dialects are spoken amid the space flights, museum heists, and car chases.",Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger is easily one of Marvel's best antagonists.,"It is epic in so many ways and important for all of us to experience, start discussions about, and champion.",A historic leap for Marvel - celebrating diversity in the midst of a heated political climate. Relatable on many levels.,"Curtiz had Errol Flynn, a man of exceptional physique and deceptively subtle acting acumen. Coogler has Chadwick Boseman, who comes into his own as a heroic movie star in the Flynn tradition.","The film takes structural whiteness to task, but quietly, implicitly, and far off-screen.","It serves as an incredibly important cultural message arriving at a crucial time, complete with stunning visuals, unforgettable and epic action-sequences.","Black Panther feels as new and refreshing as Iron Man, as [Ryan] Coogler's confidence in both the story and his talented cast has enabled him to create an enthralling yet indispensable installment in the series.",Black Panther is transcendent.,"Ultimately, Black Panther is more of the same.","Hell, it borders on Shakespearean at times.

In my childhood, I was force-fed history that 'Civilizations of color were less than superior.' NO MORE! The world needs this black superhero.","The film is smart, fast paced and action-packed, with incredible production design, costuming, and special effects. More important, it showcases a superhero who is different than any before him.","Marvel Studios usually does a good job with these films but with Black Panther, they stepped up their game and it pays off.",'Black Panther' is a great entertainment and a good movie that goes beyond its visual spectacle. [Full Review in Spanish],"Ryan Coogler's work is unique in its kind, both in terms of tone and style. [Full Review in Spanish]",It is one of the worst movies in the Marvel Universe and as an action blockbuster I find it quite conventional and awkward. [Full Review in Spanish],...people are so thirsty for representation and so ready for this movie to be the end-all-be all-of blackness on screen that they'd likely twist themselves into pretzels defending it as such even if it wound up being low-key trash.,Black Panther is the superhero movie you've been waiting for.,Coogler's ability to direct action elevates what would seem like standard set pieces into virtuosic showcases.,"Other Marvel movies have been rightfully dinged for weak villains, generic scores, visual sameness and superficial themes. The first megabudgeted superhero movie written by, directed by and largely starring black people just found what was missing.",The entire feeling of this film kind of gives you a sneak peek at what it would feel like seeing big screen interpretations of actual African heroes and heroines from our stories and folktales.,"To make such a grand statement, ya gotta break some barriers, and the film's largely black cast certainly does that, with their performances being the best part of a film loaded with great parts...","This feels like a critically important film, and a huge step forward in giving an African voice to mainstream cinema.","The most vibrant, exuberant, and purely exhilarating Marvel film yet.","Coogler and company use the intersection between myth and history well. They lionize it for emphasis and good effect, leaving you asking questions when it ends. And isn't that we want from our art?","Black Panther is not only an important movie culturally, but it's also thrilling, dramatic, and gorgeous in a way we don't get to see very often in action movies.","A wonderful story full of twists and turns, featuring one of the best villains in the MCU."
Avengers: Endgame (2019),"The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities.","""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue.",What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!,The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.,"Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride.","Part of the journey is the end, and this one is perfect for certain characters. An unprecedented movie in film history, and a very difficult feat to repeat. [Full review in Spanish]","Neither the best nor the worst of times in the franchise, it's a bit like a sugar rush. Endgame delivers both epics highs and a following crash that leaves you feeling oddly empty.","It's that the movie itself is overblown and half-baked, and without the audience, it's something of a glorified in-joke.","If Infinity War wanted to blow you away, Endgame wants to punch you in the gut and leave you a speechless, quivering wreck.","The 22nd installment is a fittingly epic, three-hour finale that packs all of the fan service you could ever want, laced with somber tones and emotional payoffs that will cause even the genre's biggest detractors to shed a tear.","It's one of the funniest movies of the 20-plus in the franchise, but it's also the one that made me the most emotional.

It's a superhero film on a scope and scale the likes of which we've never seen.,"It puts my heart racing like a locomotive in some of the most spectacular sequences I have seen in this cinematic universe that, apparently, closes a cycle to open a new one. [Full review in Spanish]","The whole thing is as sentimental as it is exhilarating, but any cheesiness feels well-earned.","All told, Endgame is a highly satisfying celebration of 10 years of the MCU, and a great bookend to the first three phases.",It was exactly what it needed to be and nothing more.,It was good.,I wouldn't have believed the breezy and tongue-in-cheek Avengers Assemble would evolve into such an odiously self-important endeavour a mere seven years later.,"As fun as the movie is, there's an undeniable hollowness at its core induced by its unwillingness to follow through on certain ideas and symbols.",podcast review,"I'm not naïve enough to suppose that anything I can say here is likely to change anyone's plans about going or not going, so I'll simply say that I enjoyed this silly but thrilling superhero free-for-all.","You would think they would go back to a time when Thanos was young and vulnerable and off him. They opt for a more intricate approach, which bored me.",Avengers: Infinity War at least had the good taste to abstain from Jeremy Renner. No such luck in Endgame.,"As expected, the film is carried by the original six Avengers, but it does a remarkable job of bringing virtually every memorable character from all 22 movies back onto the screen. It is a staggering reminder of past and present pleasures.",Endgame definitively closes a few chapters in the Avengers saga in highly satisfying fashion. It is a tremendously entertaining intergalactic trip.,"It is this part of the story, the human side, to narrow it down to our marginal planet, that holds the movie together for its three-hour run time.","Though it takes far too long to get going (the early scenes are needlessly repetitive and this would have been sharper as a 140 minute movie or somesuch), once it's up and running it's full of thrills.","While the supporting cast members often feel like benched players, the remaining Avengers' arcs do, for the most part, pay off the stories the set up by the film's first hour.",There will never be a Marvel film with an epic feel like this one. [Full Review in Spanish],"An emotional, fulfilling ride...",Endgame does what all the great Marvel movies do-it's a fun and funny action movie made by people who are experts at doing just that. But it's impossible not to be frustrated with how Marvel stumbled on the landing...,"...chock full of maudlin eddies that should have been pared back. That said, Endgame gets the job done, passing the baton as it closes out a long-running chapter with some sentimental eye rubs.","The stakes to deliver a fitting finale to the Infinity Saga are immense. But Avengers: Endgame is so darn satisfying, it will be hard to find a blockbuster that will match its emotionality or excitement.","To paraphrase Thanos, Oscar nominations are inevitable.",The directing team of Anthony and Joe Russo has found just the right vein of showmanship and self-deprecation to bring the saga to a satisfying close.,I feel like Stan Lee is probably looking down from heaven with a huge smile on his face with Avengers: Endgame,"As the dust clears, Disney stands like Thanos astride Earth-616. They have won, but what kind of world is left behind?",This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.,"You wonder how so much talent, underwritten by such an obscenely large budget, doesn't trigger more pathos.","Avengers: Endgame is a masterpiece which not only delivers on every expectation you had but exceeds ones you didn't even think about. This isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","Endgame is quite simply everything you need it to be, and everything I wanted it to be.",Avengers: Endgame is REAL great ... with an emphasis on real. Would have been my first 10 rated review ... but they killed my favorite heroes. 'Cheeseburgers...'
Us (2019),"The cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals.",The plot twists don't always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn't follow through.,"Peele's eagerly awaited second feature is here, and Us does not disappoint.","With Us, another simplistic yet petrifying demonstration of the confrontational, Jordan Peele has announced himself as a master of horror.",An amazing ensemble effort.,"A masterly double life feature that shows a comparison between good/evil, light/darkness, beautiful/putrid, and dance/violence. [Full review in Spanish]","What Us demonstrates is that Jordan Peele is not a one-hit wonder. It's easy to compare him to cinematic greats like Hitchcock or Kubrick, but he's already established that he is in a league of his own.","Taking too long to get there, Peele flubs an oddly inert home invasion when the family's maniacal scissor-wielding mirror images eventually show up. Basic jump scares abound, but there's no real terror.",Allegory seeps from every pore of the story and there's undeniable joy in untangling the myriad plot threads in the hours after the credits roll.,"Scenes and set pieces begin to drag on for too long and . . . wear thin, especially once you realize that they're simple diversions from the themes Peele is trying to address.","The larger social commentary is timely, exposing the class divides of two parallel worlds. ... yet, the underlying metaphors never fully gel with the surface-level A-story plot, which is what ""Get Out"" did so well.","This film bites with all of its teeth. It's an exercise in a certain level of brutality that we seem to reserve for those we know the best -- our family, our friends, our neighbors.","Blood spluttered it may be, but Peele shows his worth twofold as a master of the psychological horror aficionado who is on to the path to greatness.","When the best of the movie is put to the test, Peele turns the mirror back on ourselves to show how far we will go to protect things that are closest to us.","Us soars as a survival horror film with touches of humor and a great lead performance. But in terms of subject matter, what it's trying to say gets a little lost in translation.","Peele is turning into a unique, elite director whose vision integrates social commentary, terror and comedy like no one else. [Full review in Spanish]","There's a lot you can open up and analyze, but you can just watch it as a straight forward horror film too.","[Jordan] Peele clearly knows his strengths, and he's playing to them brilliantly.","Creepy, atmospheric, weird-as-balls doppelgänger horror.","The story has a very Romero-esque quality to it, with its combination of isolating horror and situational humor, while his use of the camera has a style that simultaneously recalls both Hitchcock and Kubrick.","With this film, Peele experiments again with the psychological terror and subterfuge of the home invasion subgenre, but with the intention of using the theme of the evil double to conceive a powerful sociopolitical parable. [Full review in Spanish]","Writer-director Jordan Peele's followup to the epochal 'Get Out' is as messy and overstuffed as its predecessor was direct and elegant. Still, it's a nonstop kick, bristling with milestone achievements, potent jokes and scares, and confidence...",Jordan Peele handily proves that he's one of the leading voices in horror cinema.,"This is a sprawling, messy film that finds real darkness in the spaces between what it says and what it shows","US is a thrilling creation, a maniacal contraption, fiendishly clever and beautifully constructed.",Peele crafted a film that successfully follows up his last Oscar-winning hit with something very chilling but also completely different.,"Simultaneously terrifying and hilarious, Us is a popcorn movie with the depth and gravity of Kubrick and the hair-raising suspense of peak Hitchcock.",Us is packed with excellent imagery and is easily one of the best horror films of 2019. It also disappoints by explaining its scariest material away.,Jordan Peele enjoys his second success in as many films with a straight-up horror flick that's also an acerbic social commentary.,Its cold opening and the eerie tale that follows became a test of my own emotional state that I was not prepared in any way to face. And that's just one of the ways that makes this heavily symbolic film so brilliant.,"Us is lucid and frustrating, ultimately being unable to successfully execute Peele's vision on doppelgänger with true effectiveness. [Full Review in Spanish]",Us succeeds on its adjustments to classic elements of the genre. [Full Review in Spanish],"Although it is rooted in present-day American sentiment, the powerful allegories presented in this film leave a resonance that is truly lasting. [Full Review in Spanish]","It's one thing for a movie to humble you by leaving you unsure about yourself and your place in the world; it's another for it to leave you wondering what, exactly, a filmmaker is trying to use his formidable verbal and visual vocabulary to say.","Peele develops a genuinely thrilling, heart-in-the-throat-scary horror picture.","Us deliberately leaves holes in Peele's world-building efforts. Ultimately, this helps the film's script achieve the utmost creepiness by maintaining a level of Twilight Zone-style uncertainty.",Peele's storytelling is masterfully unhinged in its execution to accommodate his unique vision.,"Every element in this film serves a purpose and is set up like a chess move, from the soundtrack to the detailed production values. (Be sure to check out the old VHS tapes in a flashback sequence).","Us is super scary, and Peele, the smart director behind Get Out, is a force to behold.","It's not a film that you simply watch. It's a cinematic experience the likes of which we see so rarely these days, and Peele's natural talent for suspense is comparable to the legendary Alfred Hitchcock, which is a compliment not to be taken lightly.",A horror masterpiece for the new age. Cannot wait to see what Peele will come up with for his next film.,"Us roots itself in the subconscious from the get-go, and then weaponizes it against you.","As far as horror movies go, and they don't go very far, this is one of the good ones. Jordan Peele has once again shown his mastery as a filmmaker, and the actors are excellent in their dual roles.","Most acclaim must go to [Jordan] Peele though as he once again has created a horror film that manages to be scary, hilarious, as well as socially relevant.","There are many joys to be had in this film, particularly the charming domesticity of the family dynamic in the first half. There's a great movie here, but the assembly is haphazard.",Peele is one of the most promising directors of the American horror resurgence.,"I love the performances, but I'm just not super sold on the script, to be honest... I'm really ready for [Jordan Peele] to be his own voice now.","Us ostensibly doesn't seem to be about race. Dig a bit deeper, though, and you can see that it's about race as much as the history of America is about race. It's about sexism, xenophobia and homophobia in the same way.","A sharp, often funny meditation on the terrifying power of human connection.",The kind of horror that could keep you up nights for the rest of your life.
Toy Story 4 (2019),"Although it's unusual for Pixar to continue a series for this long, if each new episode is going to remain this spectacular, keep them coming.","Though the film covers much of the same ground from the three previous entries, there's still enough emotional gas in the tank to make this worth seeing.","Toy Story 4 is more like an epilogue than a new chapter. A funny, moving, surreal epilogue filled with existential angst.",I'm not crying. You're crying.,"Let's hope new renditions of Disney properties continue such correctives, and that genre revisionism will again be in service.",Toy Story 4 proves there's still life in these toys in an emotionally heartfelt tale.,One of the most admirable things about Toy Story 4 is its refusal to bow to the easy call of nostalgia.,At least the end result is a fun jaunt. Anything past this would just tug its threads to a fray.,"Josh Cooley's feature debut is yet another showcase of heartfelt entertainment, alive with energy and delivering yet another tear-jerking roundhouse of a finale.","I notice the absence of magic, humor and sense of wonder that characterizes the three past films. [Full review in Spanish]","If the ""Toy Story"" trilogy took us to infinity, the fourth installment just took us beyond. Here's hoping Woody hangs his hat here and goes out on top.","It plays like a nice, warm, final hug before we all have to grow up and move on.",Woody and co will make you heartily smile in the heartfelt and wholesome fourth outing.,"Competently done, but is that all you expect from Toy Story?","It wastes none of its nearly two-hour screen time, packing the story with a lot of humanity and heart that guarantees once again that there are no dry eyes left once the credits roll.",A surprisingly fun and effective close to this venerable franchise.,Pixar is still operating at God-level here.,"Not as good as the prior two entries, this film is a fitting, if less impressive, conclusion.",I appreciate the high-level creativity in the storytelling...although there's nothing new to see...,"It appears they have found another perfect ending for the franchise, and it's time to listen to that inner-voice and close the toy box once and for all.","While not as good as the first two Toy Story pictures and probably not as good as the third, the heartfelt storyline and fun action scenes give audiences what they're looking for in a Pixar movie...","Rare is a character who has both a one-note comedy beat (executed beautifully) and an extreme amount of emotional depth. What makes Forky so compelling is not his existential crisis, but his deep empathy for others...",The latest adventure from a franchise that encourages us to find and express our purpose in life.,Toy Story 4 is a wonderful film and a beautiful (maybe?) send-off for these characters. Take some time out this summer and see what will most likely be the best franchise movie of the year and possibly the early favorite for best-animated feature.,"The idea of a fourth Toy Story film was nothing short of troubling. Thankfully, graciously, and astoundingly, Toy Story 4 is fantastic.","Nobody except the suits at Disney clamored for a fourth Toy Story movie, and yet Pixar somehow made an unnecessary sequel that feels indispensable.","Toy Story 4 is the first film in the series to introduce the concept that a toy can love another toy, and their developing relationship will pull at your heart.",There are many wonderful surprises throughout. [Full Review in Spanish],"The film surpasses its predecessors as a work of supreme visual splendour: rendering the minutiae of a rainstorm, or (in a slightly more foreboding manner) the membranous layers of dust in an antique store with hyperreal precision.","Not only is Toy Story 4 is the sequel I never knew I needed, it's quite possibly, the best Toy Story to ever be told.","I admit that in the past I've felt skeptical of the need for a new Toy Story movie. But then one opens and it wins me over, finding new ways to wring emotion and heart from a story that appeared to have run its course.","Director Josh Cooley offers plenty of excitement but he also introduces a raft of new characters -- from an antique store, a carnival and a bedroom that, frankly, has too many toys to begin with.","Toy Story 4 is the most fun film of 2019 so far, and the fact that it's also able to imbue this story with a catharsis, stakes and emotional moments is just icing on the cake.",Not absolute top-flight Pixar. No embarrassment either.,"Toy Story 4 is more of a coda than a capstone. But given its strengths, maybe that's OK.","Pixar by the numbers, this third and largely unnecessary sequel to Toy Story delivers everything you'd expect from the animation studio, minus the warmth, wit, and dread.",Toy Story 4 is so fast and light on its feet that it's easy to ignore that it's a pretty minor adventure.,"What might be the finale of this seminal series misses a chance to break new ground, but it ultimately lands on the truth about its central character.",Pixar pulls out all the stops for Toy Story 4. oy Story 4 provides the closure you didn't think you needed for this franchise.,"The existence of Forky (Tony Hale) foregrounds all sorts of existential questions that hover around the Toy Story premise. He asks the first one himself: ""Why am I alive?"" Best not to think about it too much, Forky.","It felt good to just come in and have a nice movie. This is just nice, and sweet, and endearing, and I think I kind of love it.","Although it may feel redundant, Toy Story 4 encapsulates the comedy, nostalgia and emotion that makes the series so great.","As if being one of the greatest trilogies in film history wasn't enough for the Toy Story franchise, along comes a fourth feature that's just as fun, witty, and incredibly moving as the first three.","Having only recently watched [Toy Story] 3, the closure in [Toy Story] 4 is more concrete and serves as a fitting conclusion for a series that's been about duty, friendship, and caring for others.","It is a bit of a reboot... If you can get past that, I think there are some wonderful, charming things here.","While I'm still not sure if Toy Story 4 is wholly necessary (3 ended things on such a beautiful note), the series still proves it has heart and visual creativity in unnatural abundance.","...Toy Story 4 is beyond satisfying and tear-inducing (jeesh, Pixar give my tear ducts a break), with even more closure than the third installment.","While all of the ""Toy Story"" movies have dealt with themes of friendship and finding your place in the world, ""Toy Story 4"" drives home the fact the toys are emotional avatars for all of the parents in the audience.",The fourth entry in Pixar's first and best franchise returns to some familiar places while finding a couple of new themes to explore. [Full Review in Spanish],Do not leave your seat until the very end of the credits - it will complete you.
Lady Bird (2017),"Not only incredibly authentic - perhaps cringingly so - but also marginally profound, even as its scope stays strictly on the almost unsubstantial life of a teenager.",Lady Bird flies high on heartwarming yet tough honesty.,"With Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig manages to take the old coming-of-age genre and make it feel refreshing with its authenticity and heart.",Greta Gerwig nails her solo directorial debut in this semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale where Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf's mother-daughter scenes bleed with authenticity.,"[It's] brought to fruition by a wonderful cast . . . namely Ronan and Metcalf, whose push-pull dynamic of blossoming and established worldviews encapsulate the insecurities of growing up.","Being witness to Lady Bird's growth is a beautiful experience. Not only are you enchanted by her story, but you also learn something about yourself. [Full review in Spanish]","There is something for all ages to identify with and you will find yourself torn between the generations, but ultimately feeling great affection for all of the characters. This film is a success because of the exceptional writing from Greta Gerwig.","[The film] is good, but overrated. Curiously, its faults are also overrated, in that many are characteristic of its genre.","The way Gerwig captures the stages of adolescence makes this coming-of-age film more honest than poignant. It shows that not only she is a good actress, but also a great filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]","Marion and Lady Bird's bond is very real, strong, and complicated like many mother-daughter bonds tend to be.","Gerwig shows no hesitation over putting her character in unflattering situations. The laughs come hard, they come often, and they come from all directions.",A stupendously acted and immeasurably poignant ode to the realistic bonds and barbs of life as a high school senior.,"I am awfully fond of it. This film isn't for me, but it doesn't have to be. Someone out there is going to see this film for the first time. Its heartfelt, goofy, and ever-so-slightly twee wavelength will seem to be made just for them...","Oscar-worthy performances, outstanding direction, great script (so real, raw and emotional) along with tremendous editing...","Gerwig deftly mines the family dynamics for laughs and emotion, sometimes in the same scene.","Taking the trip with [Lady Bird] is a joy, and the cast and filmmaker taking us there create a singular, authentic experience that will place Lady Bird on the list of most memorable, enjoyable coming of age films.",Lady Bird is a generous portrait from a writer/director/actress who knows something about authenticity.,"... just like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig is a creative force to be reckoned with.","Writer/Director Greta Gerwig brings her own personal story into play, delivering her Lady Bird with an enthusiastic yet defiant cheekiness, never once losing sight of the real story.",[Greta] Gerwig captures the feeling of being a high schooler so perfectly that it's nearly impossible to not identify with one of the characters in some way.,Gerwig hits the nail on the head for her first solo directorial project.,Never has the tug of war mother-daughter relationship been so brutally honest on film.,As irregular and imperfect as any debut of someone who has something valuable to tell. [Full Review in Spanish],One of the best films of the year. [Full Review in Spanish],"Forget the insane hype and you may have a better experience with it. Gerwig's script is gentle and accessible, but also lacks the surprises of a Lena Dunham (Girls) screenplay, the sass of what Diablo Cody (Juno) might have brought to things...","Coming-of-age movies can often feel as ubiquitous as superhero films, yet Lady Bird turns out to be one of those special efforts that manages to leapfrog over the competition with a single bound.","It's 2002 and 17-year-old Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is interred in a Catholic high school in California while dreaming resentfully of the East Coast college she's convinced she deserves.","Greta Gerwig's movie flies with humor and universal, high school truths.",Lady Bird exposes the intoxication with the hallucinatory cocktail of hormones processed by a brain without the experience to sort them.,A beautifully performed and smartly written coming-of-age comedy that displays an astonishing mastery of craft and character.,"With the latest star-making performance from Saoirse Ronan, Lady Bird is charming and clever and goofy and touching and honest and incredible.","It leans into the complications, the conflicts, the counterintuitive characteristics of growing up, and it's that willingness to allow for paradoxes that establishes its excellence.","Lady Bird takes the tired genre of the coming-of-age story and presents it with an awesome script, real heart, fantastic performances, and honesty.",This is just a delightful movie.,"An achingly relatable relationship between mother and daughter, courtesy of first-time director Greta Gerwig, who knows a thing or two about angst-riddled female characters.",The only reason we can relate to it is because of Ronan and Metcalf's brilliant performances.,"This subtle and perceptive coming-of-age film announces Gerwig as a fully-fledged director whose career, I suspect, will be well worth following.",A beautiful movie that feels as honest as it should. Relationships had never been as powerful as they are portrayed here. [Full review in Spanish].,It's very well done and feels authentic and natural.,"Even though some of the jokes are rather obvious, Lady Bird is hugely funny from start to finish, witty writing and sharp sight gags earning the steady stream of laughs one would expect from Gerwig.","It is here the film really shines, throwing a spotlight on a relationship that is so often complicated, and one that female audiences will find completely relatable.","Writer/director Greta Gerwig announces her presence with authority on this one, crafting a remarkable semi-autobiographical portrait of growing up that precisely captures a moment in time.","The relationship between mothers and daughters is what's at the heart of Lady Bird, and while cringe-worthy at times, it's a beautiful, poignant story that resonated with me.","The characters are meaningful and fascinating, the narrative is no slouch, and the story, incredibly simple, is grandiose in terms of gracefulness and spirit.","Lady Bird is a film that describes the joys, mistakes and dramas of teenage years more eloquently than anything you might see this year.","The performances are terrific, the dialogue whip-smart, but on a personal level this film didn't grab me.

Sympathy for the preposterous Mr. Kane survives. Indeed, there is something about him which seems admirable.","The construction is deliberately episodic, and individual settings often appear to owe more to the modern conceptions of stage-technique than to the cinema. But the ingenuity with which the episodes are assembled sets a new level in film-construction.","Welles' performance is nothing less than astonishing.

The way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another War Party was a sonic experience I need to see more of.","""Mad Max Fury Road"" is one of the worst and meaningless movies I have ever seen.","It's fine B-grade mulch, but it's certainly no masterpiece...it's surprising, and a tad disheartening, how readily Fury Road falls into line with so many other production-line blockbusters.","This is one of the few movies I've ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in.",The entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters.,"In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously - reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. Fury Road is rife with activity and fertile with ideas.","Charlize Theron as Furiosa is freaking amazing in this film. She fights, she's badass, she's so great.","I left the theatre trembling and with my hands sweating, and that's the best compliment one can give to a movie of this kind. Let the sequels come!

I was impressed.,It's a solid movie. It's really good. I thought Lady Gaga is fantastic.,Pop singer Lady Gaga is quite good as the wife... she subtly and convincingly manages the character's transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self-confident celebrity.,"More like A Star Is Bored. Am I right? No? I'm the only one who isn't gaga for Gaga? Fine, then.","This is high melodrama of a kind rarely seen these days, or executed this well at any time.",A fantastic first film from a great actor turned director with a stellar performance by a Queen of Pop who might become a star in a totally different medium.,"Like all the best love stories their relationship reaches out beyond the screen, and asks the audience to experience the highs and lows, as if they were these characters.","A Star Is Born is a beautiful, powerful, and tragic depiction of not simply the life, glamor, fun and fame of music super stardom, but also of a life riddled with addictions and self-destructive behaviors.","[Bradley Cooper] didn't disappoint. Delivering probably the most lived-in, carefully layered performance of his career, his Jackson is both a creature of charisma and self-pity.","Both leads do incredibly nuanced work, and while [Lady] Gaga's performance is incredible, so is [Bradley] Cooper's.","It's a splendid Hollywood Romance, sure, but the little textural details - the licks of sweaty hair plastered to shiny, crinkled foreheads - tell of frailty and authenticity.","A Star Is Born is layered, fulfilling, and moving to the point where only singing can properly capture the emotional complexity of some of the film's heavier moments.",A Star is Born is best when it forgets what it's trying to be about and is just about the relationship at its core. Nothing more.,"Even in its fourth rendition, A Star is Born hits the right emotional highs.",You should see A Star is Born... no questions asked.,It is wonderful to see how such a story can still be alive and be so universal. [Full Review in Spanish],Director [Bradley] Cooper knows what he needs to get out of Gaga and what power she has when she is near a microphone. Gaga also surprises by matching Cooper pound for a pound as they share the frame.,"Having wowed the cognoscenti at the Venice International Film Festival, Bradley Cooper's directorial first has touched down in cinemas amid a blaze of rapturous publicity.","This film has it all, and the performances are beyond expectations. Cooper was already an excellent actor, but he has set a high bar for himself now as a director. And this will not be the last time you will see Lady Gaga acting in a lead role.","The moment when she first steps up to that mic is one of the most breathtaking things we've seen on screen in recent memory, a moment of iconic weight that feels as if we're seeing Lady Gaga for the first time.",Cooper creates an atmosphere of intimacy that makes us feel that we are part of this adventure of success and tragedy [Full Review in Spanish],"Overall, A Star is Born soars on the chemistry of its lead performances, as we genuinely believe and appreciate Jackson and Ally's love for one another.","Bradley Cooper's directorial debut and Lady Gaga's cinematic debut hits a lot of great notes, but it's far from polished or perfect.",A... love story?,"Despite slow pacing and an unsatisfying conclusion, ""A Star is Born"" is great due to the soundtrack and performances of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.","Despite the way the middle of the film sags as it observes but never really engages with the industry, it knows the wisdom in returning to the small-scale humanity of Ally and Jackson for the end.","Cooper's impressive directorial efforts give the film an effortless air that recalls the direction of Clint Eastwood and David O. Russell, and perhaps it's no coincidence that his best performances are their films...",There are plenty of bright spots in A Star is Born but it's Gaga who really shines as Ally.,"Heart-breaking but hopeful, this is the new definitive Hollywood story.","Working with the familiar and skewing it in a manner that makes the final product feel fresh, not to mention the emotion evoked throughout, lends A Star Is Born an air of undeniable elation","In an age where a star is supposedly born with every few thousand clicks of a mouse, it's refreshing to watch people do it - and do it well - the old-fashioned way.","I'd like to see Director Cooper take a ""road less traveled"" in the future. Still, I admire his effort.","In ""A Star is Born, two stars and love songs shine.","What really works about this version is the fact that Bradley Cooper co-wrote it, he produced it and stars in it, and put it together but he incorporates little elements of Lady Gaga's Story."
Wonder Woman (2017),"The overuse of computer-augmented imagery and wirework and fully computer-animated characters makes everything look just a bit faker, especially during showdowns.",Diana's a strong role model for young girls as she's a fighter and has no time for the typical gender roles placed in society.,Gal Gadot is simply extraordinary.,"Wonder Woman would have been a powerful statement just by its mere existence. Instead, we are treated to a definitive genre classic in its own right.",Wonder Woman deserves the success and praise not just because the film is about an empowering female superhero that will undoubtedly inspire the younger generation and women alike - it's just a good film period.,"Go see Wonder Woman solely for the fact that it's a fantastic, well made, exciting and emotional film. In fact, I can honestly say, without hyperbole, that this is one of the best superhero movies ever.","Wonder Woman is not only the depiction of a powerful woman that men and women alike needs to see, it's a metaphor for ourselves as well. It's a win for a comic movie universe that very much needed one.","Excellent character development, funny moments and epic action scenes. Jenkins did it: she created the first great film in the DC Extended Universe. [Full review in Spanish]",This film is full of 'fish-out-of-water' humour which comes from a demi-god negotiating the world of men. It is also visually stunning and the action scenes are thrilling - coupling the world of superheroes with WWI works surprisingly well.,"Wonder Woman is a flawed superhero origin story. With that out of the way, the good news is it's mostly awesome, brings one of the greatest comic book characters ever to the big screen, and breaks up the boys' club that is contemporary superhero cinema.","Although it has a charismatic role from Gal Gadot, it has nothing exciting for two hours that turns wonderful to yawn. [Full review in Spanish]",It was totally entertaining. I'm excited to see more of these movies.,Part of what I really liked about this movie was that it focused on her as a character and a human being.,"Judged on equal footing as all other superhero films, as it and all movies should be, this is a terrific action film, a sly take on gender politics of the early 1900s, and a wonderfully crafted antiwar picture.",... the directing by Patty Jenkins who shows that she can take a good script and turn out great scenes and coherence. Her way of directing works fantastically well with lead Gal Gadot's interpretation of Wonder Woman.,"Wonder Woman stands proudly on its own, and a frankly astonishing sequence of Diana crossing No Man's Land alone pushes a fun blockbuster directly into iconic territory.","At least, finally the DCCU seems willing to learn from its mistakes and improve over previous entries.","Gal Gadot's performance is fantastic to watch, she not only carries the entire film, but she also brings strength, intelligence, compassion and beauty to her role.","Making the Hero with a Thousand Faces a woman proves the primal power of the oldest story by opening it up to half the world. After untold thousands of years, it still works.","Jenkins' Diana is vulnerable but strong, compassionate but fierce, good-hearted but no pushover. This film is a solid springboard for Diana to be fleshed out in further instalments.",Wonder Woman brings joy and compassion to the DC Universe.,"Gal Gadot is perfect in this role as she conveys compassion, athleticism and a sense of innocence as she experiences life outside of Themyscira.",Kudos for all those involved at DC and Warner Bros. in making this woman-helmed and woman-led film so very entertaining.,"Gadot - who I'm not yet convinced is a great actor - is one hundred percent perfect in this role, to the extent that it would be a much poorer movie without the zeal and charisma which she brings to the titular Princess of the Amazons.","Not a great film, but it is a good one.","Not only is Wonder Woman an action film for all ages and genders, but it has a great positive message: no matter how ugly the world gets because of war and dictators, we must be good, protect one another and do right by one other.",The superhero film is dripping with engaging characters and you find yourself engrossed with the story. But the film takes a sharp detour in its second half to unveil something incredibly formulaic and predictable.,"A triumph and the first truly great DC Films release, Wonder Woman exceeds every expectation and stands tall as one of the greatest superhero movies of all-time.","Its brain, sense of spectacle, its excellent visual and its approach to an icon of popular culture place it as one of the best superhero movies since 'The Dark Knight' of Christopher Nolan. [Full review in Spanish]",Wonder Woman is a pure delight.,". Where Snyder's films thus far have been dismal 9/11 rehashing oddities, Jenkins has made the first film to capture the magic DC's always represented in the four color world. It's a treasure to have it here on the silver screen.","In her own movie, Wonder Woman has less lines of dialogue than her ""supporting"" love interest, expresses no personality and doesn't even really save the day.","Rather than a reliance on flashy effects and over-the-top, apocalyptic plots, Wonder Woman  remains grounded in a totally refreshing way.","For the film to reach its conclusion Diana must be confronted by the limits and power of humankind. She must understand the wonder of humanity. And for the film to work, we must be in wonder of her. And we are.","Wonder Woman is easily the best DCEU movie to date. The CGI is sub par, but is forgotten during the epic battles, and thrilling plot points.",Wonder Woman is awesome and awe-inspiring. An all-round captivating piece of cinema.,"Wonder Woman may not be perfect, but it's a validation for young girls everywhere of their strength and value, and it's the first superhero film in a long time that made me look forward to a sequel.","The imperative to eradicate any hint of bossiness or anger from her character weighs heavily on the film, threatening to turn it into one long, dispiriting exercise in allaying male fears about powerful women.",Congrats to Patty Jenkins and everyone involved for finally giving me a blockbuster I actually cared about! Thank you!,"Wonder Woman not only fulfils all the criteria of a superhero movie but is also engaging, exciting and inspiring throughout","Gal Gadot absolutely rocks as the mighty Wonder Woman, as well as the sweet and compassionate Diana. It's not just the best DCEU film so far, it's a solid and hugely entertaining film, period.","Some aspects of the story are also a bit over the top, but then again, it is a superhero movie. Overall, go watch it.","The opening act drags with exposition and the climax slips into the same fire and brimstone mixtape so beloved of DC. But that status also buys it an inspiring, revolutionary spirit that your average neighborhood superhero film can only dream of.","Wonder Woman is smart and engaging, funny and fun; there's far more humor and heart here than in any other DC offering.",Director Patty Jenkins knocks it out of the park with this film.,"We've never had a superhero film directed by a female director, and after what Jenkins has delivered, this clearly needs to change immediately.","Wonder Woman, simply put, is a wonder.","Like Zeus breathing life into the world creating man, so does [director Patty] Jenkins breathe life into the DCEU.","It isn't groundbreaking in structure, but its exhibition of strong female heroism amidst conflicts of the past just elevates everything...","A nuanced message of hope and mercy in a violent world? A superhero motivated by love and a desire for peace? A visionary portrayal of femininity in all its beauty, complexity, and strength? I'm with her."
Dunkirk (2017),"If one can ignore the infuriating narrative structuring, there are plenty of technical achievements worth seeing.","It's an emotional gauntlet, as you'll be glued to the edge of your seats with your eyes staring at the screening.",A good film. Nothing else.,"Its structural experimentation makes it one of Nolan's most intense, incisive and emotionally engaging works.","Christopher Nolan recreates the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk by fracturing the narrative across three overlapping timelines: an hour in the air with Tom Hardy, a day at sea with Mark Rylance, and a week on shore with Kenneth Branagh.","Dunkirk is more than just a war film. You're watching a survival horror film, a psychologically, relentless suspense trip that Hitchcock would be proud of. It results in a film that leaves you breathless.","In style and execution, [Christopher Nolan] has made not just one of his very best works, and not only one of the best films of the year - Dunkirk is one of the best war films of the decade.","Even with the loud sound atmosphere, the lack of storytelling will get you yawning. [Full review in Spanish]","With an unexpected narrative structure, Christopher Nolan creates a breathtaking modern war classic.",Dunkirk is an inspirational and emotional film that does justice to a very important moment in world history.,"To be an anti-war film in which almost everything is overturned by minimalism, we think it is a breath of originality that revitalizes the genre. [Full review in Spanish]","As a technical achievement, I'd certainly give the framework high praise, but as an instrument in delivering high drama, I'm less than convinced. This is still very much a recommendation.","The marriage of performance, sound, structure, and downright astonishing visuals makes Dunkirk the ultimate moviegoing experience.","There is nothing clinical about it, just good old-fashioned elbow grease filmmaking. Sometimes, it's all it takes.","By bringing Dunkirk in at a brisk (for him) 106 minutes, Nolan rediscovers his gift for concision that made his early gems like Memento so pleasing.",[O]ne of the most captivating and compelling films of the year so far.,"With a dedication to excellent ""show don't tell"" presentation, stunning cinematography and a downright scary soundtrack and score, Dunkirk succeeds at putting viewers in the thick of an unsung but no less dark time of the Second World War.","A lofty divorce from Nolan's usual genre oriented flavor, this plays best as a multi-perspective experience of survival and rescue rather than a character driven ensemble as suggested by its cast.","Nolan has managed to make a masterpiece in a genre crowded with masterpieces, one that will likely be held up as one of the best ever about World War II.",[Dunkirk] is massive and impressive.,Nolan's knack for 'sculpting in time' reaches a new apex. Dunkirk is to Nolan as 'David' is to Michelangelo. It's his masterpiece.,"From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.","The cinematography was exceptional with shots from above of a vast waterway and close up views of the beach, inside a ship, and the French shoreline.",A perfect machine of a movie. Nolan adapts all feelings associated with war into a technical masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish].,Went the war well?,"It leans into the things Nolan likes: frenetic editing, proficient technical aspects, and a storyline that reads like a puzzle. The result is a film that affects but never charms, a solid but brittle film.",It's the kind of movie magic rarely seen in film these days.,It felt a little cold to me...and that's what keeps this movie from being great.,"No warm cups of tea, no cosy home fires burning: writer-director Christopher Nolan throws his audience into the war zone and it never lets up.",Christopher Nolan's precision-engineered war epic has a stopwatch where a heart should be,"It possesses many of the virtues and vices of Steven Spielberg's epics, wrapped in a Union flag instead of the Stars and Stripes. It looks terrific, though it is noisier than any battle I have ever attended. It contains some adequate acting...",It's a stunning film that ranks among the best of both his own filmography and the genre as a whole.,It's an experience you won't soon forget.,[Dunkirk] is one of the best war movies of the 21st century.,A distinguished and unpretentious epic war film whose outcome is powerful and sublime.,An excellent addition to Nolan's filmography. [Full Review in Spanish],"We walk out not with an irrational feeling of hope, or the blinding high of redemption. We aren't supposed to. The Miracle of Dunkirk is, by nature, not the definitive page of history...","Dunkirk is gripping, tense, flawlessly crafted, emotionally exhausting, and genuinely unforgettable.",Dunkirk is the masterwork Christopher Nolan's career has been building towards.,"Dunkirk may be short on words but it is not short on brilliance. And despite the tiny boats, big ships, darting planes, lumbering lorries and repeated identical queues, Nolan's spotlight shines on humanity in all its bravery and mundanity.",This is one heck of a stunning war picture.,"Christopher Nolan cements his directorial seal on the historical drama genre with ""Dunkirk,"" a sweeping World War II film unlike anything you've ever seen before.","Dunkirk is a intense film with beautiful visuals, an equally beautiful score by Hans Zimmer and director in Christopher Nolan that is at the top of his game both narratively and visually.","At its best, a visceral and immediate experience; unlike almost anything Nolan has done, is devoid of the operation of deciphering and understanding. [Full review in Spanish]","Nolan always makes films that engage the brain as much as any other faculty, and here, we see a film that is as visceral and experiential as anything he's ever done.","Christopher Nolan has once again out-performed expectations to deliver a film which isn't just an experience, it is a work of art.",Dunkirk is both the quietest and loudest of Christopher Nolan's films.,"Oblivious at best and propaganda at worst, Dunkirk is admittedly a sensory feast but one that leaves me concerned about its palpable nostalgia for an era before women's liberation and civil rights movements.","This is a story that needed to be told in a way that only Christopher Nolan can bring, and his non-linear style only enhances my desire for multiple viewings.",Dunkirk depicts World War II with barely an ounce of jingoism for maximum emotional effect.
Inside Out (2015),A keenly cinematic balancing act of insight and understanding.,"Inside Out is a return to form for John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and all the folks at Pixar.","While it simplifies a lot of those complexities..., as far as the morality of the story goes, it's nice to see a story embrace those emotional qualities. It achieves that through brilliant comedic timing and some genuine heartfelt moments.","An ingenious, moving story about the pain of growing up and handling big, new emotions that delights older and younger viewers alike.","Inside Out is as funny as it is emotional. It's a rare comedy that can bring both tears of sadness and joy to your eyes, sometimes within seconds of each other.","With Inside Out, Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, repeat the formula of Pixar's originality with an imaginative and totally affective trip. [Full review in Spanish]","Even after having a narrative so magnified that it focuses on the mental faculties of one person, it remains universal and penetrating.","I teared up, as I do in every Pixar movie.","The movie, I thought, was really cute.","Great filmmaking is empathetic. It lets us experience the world through the eyes of someone else, and connects a specific experience to a larger, shared whole. Inside Out is great filmmaking.","Overall, Disney Pixar does an amazing job on digging into kids' feelings and the importance of letting people know how you feel.","Like classic Looney Tunes, Inside Out is ostensibly directed at kids, but speaks even deeper volumes to adults. It's funny and exciting, and its lessons go down easy.","The usual brilliant animation by Pixar and great voice acting by the likes of Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Diane Lane just make this unusual film that much better.","[T]he writing is intelligent and clever, filled with witticisms and tongue-in-cheek double entendres...Combining story and visuals, there are more than enough elements of wackiness to keep a perpetual smile on your face.","Well voiced, multi-layered, fearless, gorgeous, and inventive.","Three of the last four Pixar movies have been sequels. Perhaps the expectation that this original idea would be up to par with their excellent past was simply too lofty. Look at me, I feel something other than Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger or Fear.","Display(s) a keen understanding of childhood and its most precious joys and deepest fears, synthesizing them into something that is instantly relatable to children and adults alike.","Inside Out's brainy script is matched both by its visual splendor, often invoking the spirit of Miyazaki, and its humanist reach, which extends to both family and (imaginary) friend alike.",Almost as if someone realized that kids were people too...Inside Out truly pushed the envelope when it comes to kiddy flicks.,Inside Out lovingly explores the complex interplay of emotional turmoil with Pixar's apparently endless talent for innovation and visual design.,"Inside Out should be required viewing for the parents of pre-teens, just as those embarrassing ""What's Happening To Me?"" books are must-reads for growing minds and bodies.",A beautiful film.,"Honestly, casting is pretty spot-on across the board for the film.",An absolute joy...

But that doesn't make it a better movie.,This is what Pixar is brilliant at: showing us animation with an emotionally honest story.,Inside Out is outstanding. Astonishing. Sensational.,"The brilliance of Inside Out... is in the gentle, almost cheery way in which it celebrates sadness as a useful, hardworking, perfectly normal, and perfectly lovable aspect of how a girl grows up."
The Farewell (2019),"Such an average, uneventful, small, intimately-designed, down-to-earth, slice-of-life drama that very little of it is memorable.",The fact it's based on writer-director Lulu Wang's real life experiences only adds the poignancy.,"As authentic and involving as a family drama could hope to be, and one of the most effective takes on the tension between culture and identity seen in the last few years",The Farewell packs a powerful emotional punch while still offering plenty of humor to give it some levity.,"Wang has produced an utter marvel of a film. The Farewell is a beautiful, resonating gem, fuelled by some standout performances and told with touches of pure grace.","It's about watching, about waiting. It's when it's at its most natural that The Farewell connects the inside and the outside with an honesty that's hard to resist.","The second film as director of Lulu Wang doesn't move me nor does it seem funny, but I can't deny that it contains a certain intimacy with the intercultural treaty that describes the vicissitudes of a Chinese family. [Full review in Spanish]","""The Farewell"" will fill you with the same feeling as Yasujirô Ozu's Japanese masterpiece ""Tokyo Story."" You'll want to immediately pick up the phone, call your grandparents and tell them how much you love them.","Injecting what is a tragic setup with comic elements requires a precarious balancing act from the filmmaker and star alike, but Wang and Awkwafina traverse the tightrope without a wobble.","The Farewell becomes a gentle, universal plea that showcases all the perks and drawbacks of having a family.","It's endearing and sad, but Wang's approach has a rather optimistic tone that serves perfectly with a fantastic cast. [Full review in Spanish].",A poignant look at cultural identity and its place in modern society.,"The Farewell may be a difficult sit for anyone who has lost a loved one, but it's a worthwhile one as it keenly captures the glorious awfulness and fabulous ridiculousness of family.","What The Farewell isolates so incisively is a sense of cultural melancholia specific to the immigrant experience, a mourning for something lost in the process of existing between worlds.","So well-acted, you felt it. I thought it was a really, really solid movie, and I was very surprised by it.","The Farewell is among 2019's best films. It becomes deeper, funnier and more resonant with repeated viewing, too.","Wang's film simmers on a low flame, which is also the source of its charm and the empathy it stirs.","This is a humane, wise treasure of a movie.","The Farewell reminds us that callous statements of the ""go back to wherever you came from"" nature are not only racist but demonstrate a pernicious lack of empathy. Nobody leaves home without a good reason.","A fascinating film, very well observed ... highlighting all those contradictions, as we might see them, that I do find myself on occasion disagreeing with, but having no leg to stand on.","For obvious reasons it's a film that is close to the director's heart and while not as funny as it could be, its earnestness just about wins through in the end.",'The Farewell' is one of the best movies of 2019. [Full review in Spanish],This intimate tragi-comedy is one of the very best films of 2019.,"Not only well-written, but superbly directed with wonderful (and often understated performances).","Playing a character who allows endless opportunities to speak her heart pass her by, Awkwafina displays her full heartbreaking range dealing with the worst situation imaginable.","...The Farewell is an equally hilarious and heartbreaking examination of grief, family and tradition.",[Lulu] Wang positions herself as a director of great maturity... and I really hope she continues to have the opportunity to tell more stories of this level. [Full review in Spanish],"Until the closing shot, this is a celebration of Asian actors, traditions, and relationships, never tainted with the need to please multiplex audiences of the west.","The Farewell is certainly dialogue-heavy, but it captures the Wang family dynamic through blocking and movement, as Billi both stands out as a westerner in her former homeland, and gets caught up in the sweep of family rituals and idiosyncrasies.","The Farewell is a personal, compelling family dramedy, but the film goes beyond its premise and genre conventions - carefully unpacking questions about the division between cultural value systems and ways of thinking.","Shoulders hunched, head slung forward, and a look of deep, determined bereavement on her face, Awkwafina makes Billi's grief a palpable force, and it renders the final seconds of The Farewell intensely touching.","What follows is a series of hackneyed scenes about the different interpersonal relationships within the family, centering on the heroine's bond with her grandmother.","You've probably never heard of Shuzhen Zhao who brings Nai Nai to life, but she will create a lasting memory in this role. She's spunky, smart, trusting, and above all, loving, exactly what the term ""grandma"" means.","Thematically, The Farewell is about reconciliation with the past and wrestling with cultural traditions that now seem foreign in a country that once was home.

Oh yes, Awkwafina was very good.",A marvelous exploration of family and getting a jump on the grieving process.,"Written and directed by Lulu Wang, The Farewell plays out around dinner tables like an Ira Sachs family drama with a cutting, deadpan sense of humor.","An extraordinarily gentle drama that is thought-provoking in the nicest, most pleasant way.","In just 100 minutes of screen time, Wang has brought a contentious, ethical issue to a human level and wrapped it with heart.",It's a very rewarding film assembled with a disarming touch of brilliance.,"'The Farewell' is a rewarding film for the ages. It has its tears, undoubtedly; but it also has many laughs and uplifting moments to carry you through your own obstacles.",The whole cast is perfect. [Full review in Spanish],The Farewell ends up being an interesting reflection about lies. [Full Review in Spanish],"Wang moves with discretion between simplicity and eccentricity, addressing solemn themes without any artificiality.

Though a few moments slip into cliche territory, even these work, as Krasinski and crew lean fully into the kind of film they're making.",The best moments depend on the silence broken by sound. Like a bloodcurdling scream. Like the blasting of fireworks in the sky. And like that final sound cue.,"Just as much a tale of family resilience as it is a survivalist horror film, A Quiet Place is masterful genre filmmaking that soars leaps and bounds above expectation.","Sometimes, especially in thrillers and horror, a simple idea can be very effective, as long as the execution can maintain the tension.","I was worried throughout that we were going to get to a third act over-explanation, and we don't.",A Quiet Place epitomizes what great horror stories should be.,"A Quiet Place is, without a doubt, one of the most surprising, fun and effective thrillers of the year.

Many of the scenes were so intense that you'll be on the edge of your seat. You may even hold your own breath trying not to make a sound too.,A Quiet Place is flipping fantastic.,"The most ordinary of mishaps - such as an exposed nail - can lead to disaster, as Krasinski shows in one unbearably taut, agonisingly prolonged sequence, the tension winding tighter and tighter until we're ready to scream, even if the characters can't.","An almost old-fashioned horror that blends psychological battery with hideous, murderous monsters to near-perfection. It's a 90 minute crescendo of suspense, peppered with shocks and heartbreak.","An overall delightful film that will become a gem on your shelf, with stellar performances, a unique script, and stunning directorial choices - A Quiet Place will leave you speechless.","While it may not boast the sociopolitical gravitas that informed Get Out, it's nevertheless a treat for anyone who likes movies that go bump in the night.",The sound design is super important toward the narrative and meaning of the film.,"Whereas so many scary movies are rooted in a backhanded, ironic breed of cynicism - what's more monstrous in monster movies than the people trying to survive the monsters? - A Quiet Place appeals to the better angels of our nature."

[Full Review in Spanish]",What elevates Modern Times - above even its cleverness - is its sense of spectacle. It's as entertaining as it is socially and politically resonant.,"The film as a whole means no more than Charlie Chaplin means. Nobody has ever been able to say what that is, but by the present showing it is something quite timeless and priceless, and more human than the best of alien words lugged in for definition.",Chaplin's hilarious comedy still is one of the most poignant critiques of modernization and mechanization of mass production.,Families will cherish Chaplin's silent slapstick.,Perhaps the highlight of Chaplin's late career,the fact that it is one of Chaplin's great masterpieces is testament to both his artistic resilience in the face of industry change and the enduring power of great silent comedy.,"Modern Times magically reaches forward through the decades, resonating loudly for these difficult modern times.","There can be no better description for Modern Times-or indeed, Chaplin's career-than the film's initial title card: ""A story of industry, of individual enterprise-humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness."" [Blu-ray]",...an enduring masterpiece that grows more relevant with each passing day.,"It is a gay, impudent and sentimental pantomimic comedy in which even the anachronisms are often as becoming as Charlie Chaplin's cane.","Sometimes sentimental yet highly comical, Chaplin's anti-industrialisation statement is wholly idealistic but its topical reflection on industrial paranoia still resonates today.","One of the many remarkable things about Charlie Chaplin is that his films continue to hold up, to attract and delight audiences.","The picture is grand fun and sound entertainment, though silent.

Eighth Grade (2018),Eighth Grade has a way of hitting you right between the eyes with the real-life turmoil of being a teenager no matter how old you are now.,"Because of its aim to highlight the negative aspects that shape transitions into adulthood, the film poses a unique, profound perspective.","Burnham's film gets the job done, delivering a fresh spin on the teenage angst genre.","You really feel the awkwardness, the embarrassment, cringe-worthy nature of Kayla and other kids in school trying to act older than they are.","This is a very good film, and not a gratuitously cruel one.","Thank you, Bo Burnham, for crafting this marvelous gem that speaks to both teenagers and the teenagers inside the rest of us.","Writer/director Bo Burnham brilliantly dissects modern teenage life with a sympathetic lead performance by Elsie Fisher.

Burnham and Fisher hit upon too many defining aspects of the young-teen experience to list,"[Director Bo] Burnham may have crafted a simple story about the most ordinary of teenage girls, but it speaks with the emotions of a true cinematic epic.",Unmissable piece of art.,Burnham has made a minor classic.,"A sweet, funny, wonderfully nuanced coming-of-age film that modifies the daily trauma of being 13 for a digital age that demands at least the pretence of a perfectly realised life.","While Kayla Day is very much a teenager of her precise time and place, her gruelling anxiety - and Fisher's wonderful yearning in the role - make her universally relatable anyway.","Eighth Grade is also deeply sweet in unexpected places and howlingly funny, attuned to the timeless indignities of any adolescence.","Despite the harsh realities of teenage life in the social media era, this is an incredibly positive movie with a closing beat that delivers a powerful message for young people: give yourself a break."
It Happened One Night (1934),It Happened One Night has only gotten better over the years; its vivid and amusing depiction of a bygone social culture adding to its impressive charms.,"The screenplay is sensational, alternating between dramatic, comedic, and romantic, handling each with remarkable care.",A very merry picture and one which puts Gable back on the map as an ace matinee idol.,It Is pleasant to travel across the United States with these two bickering vagabonds.,"The story is improbable, but it is consistently entertaining and it has several sequences which are guaranteed to reduce any normal audience to a state of agreeable hysteria.","I have seen Claudette Colbert better cast. She has too much character to suggest a helpless heiress who has never been allowed out alone before. However, most of the acting is excellent, and Frank Capra's direction is full of effective touches.",It's all about the snappy dialogue and simmering tension between these hugely charismatic stars.,"A charming, human, believable story, with charming, human, believable characters.","It Happened One Night is as lively, witty and romantic as ever. Buoyed up by dual performances from two of the era's greats, Capra's film maintains its status as a classic.","It's sweet, cheerful, funny, and very, very good.","One of the best comedies of its era, with a rich inventiveness of character and situation.",Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film that defied expectations to such an outrageous extent that the cinema has never fully recovered from its impact or influence.,"It's probably more historically important than it is a masterpiece (the last 20 minutes take the missed conections and misunderstandings an inch too far), but it's still very easy to fall in love with.","The direction is excellent. Frank Capra never lets his picture lag for a moment. It is never very exciting, but it moves along snappily and it is full of amusing situations.","Perhaps not the greatest of the screwball comedies, but Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the racier.","Viewed even today with all of its plot elements recycled ad nauseam by Hollywood (for rom-coms, road trip comedies, odd couple/buddy films, etc.), the film still holds up because we believe Gable and Colbert and can identify with them both right away.","It's nearly impossible to find anyone who doesn't love it. Or doesn't feel, in some way, that it speaks to them.","It Happened One Night was in many ways a predecessor to the modern romantic comedy, and its dynamics will still feel familiar to the current-day viewer.",It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.,"It's funny, beautifully directed and acted and it's always been one of my favourites.","As buoyant and elegant as bubbles in a glass of champagne, Frank Capra's sublime 1934 comedy... survives triumphantly because of its wit, charm, romantic idealism and its shrewd sketch of married life.","Among the more gratifying phenomena of the current season has been the growing recognition of It Happened One Night, the Frank Capra production of last year, as one of the few potential classics of the recent cinema.",A delightful free-wheeling comedy.,Still one of the best screwball comedies.,A screwball comedy with charm and sass it established a template that countless films have followed down the decades.,It Happened One Night is pure delight.,As classy and charming a romantic comedy as you're ever likely to see...,Both stars loathed the experience yet turned in two of their most enduring performances.,"The picture is pretty much nonsense and quite dreary, except for natural touches of the habits of the travellers.","Instead of attempting a journalistic study of bus-travel, regularly punctuated by comic touches, Director Frank Capra and Robert Riskin who adapted Samuel Hopkins Adams' story, fused the two.",An old school classic.,With Gable and Colbert on top form this is a charming and memorable comedy.,"One of those stories that without a particularly strong plot manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and direction.","The story of a runaway heiress falling in with a devilish, wise-cracking reporter on a cross-country roadtrip now seems like a clich only because so many other films have copied its structure.","This charming romantic comedy, while grounded in the context of the Depression, offered light fare that's uncharacteristic of Capra. It might have been the first true sleeper since no one involved anticipated such critical and commercial success.","This is Capra at his best, very funny and very light, with a minimum of populist posturing.","Only minorly dated, this film would play well for modern audiences despite being more than 70 years old.","Capra's sense of humour is a little like that of Preston Sturges, though less caustic; and the film shows its stars at their best, Colbert as one of Hollywood's fresher comediennes, Gable as dumb-but-loveable hunk.",Who can resist a movie where the girl's father provides his daughter with a getaway car from her own wedding?,"It Happened One Night is a true classic in every sense of the word, one that withstands the test of time and indeed defies it completely.","The romantic comedy that all others draw from, few imitate effectively, and none have been able to replicate.",,A very funny and breezy comedy.,,"Not only will the Walls of Jericho fall, but so will the walls of your heart.","One of the most enduring romantic comedies of Hollywood's golden age… The opposites-attract comedy still works, though Gable’s dismissive treatment of pampered Colbert, which played well with Depression-era audiences, seems dated today.","It Happened One Night is a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes.",This classic comedy is the first movie ever to sweep the five major Oscar categories.,Still as good as everyone says it is.,"It dates badly, but there's enough here to make it worthwhile"
Booksmart (2019),"Fast, frank, graphically sexual exchanges populate the script, but it never becomes grating.","""With such a fully formed debut, it's hard not to fall in love with Booksmart. It offers laughs, tears and heart by the bucket-load""","In the end, this is a movie you end up liking despite its faults.","A movie like Booksmart comes along to remind us that we were actually heroes, no matter what group we belonged to.","And Booksmart is incredibly smart to use a similar concept to tell a story that is much more at ease with itself, without trying to force a narrative.","An astonishing coming-of-age story that hardly goes by the books and honestly, it's hard to believe that this is Olivia Wilde's directing debut.",Olivia Wilde is a tour-de-force of filmmaking.,"Olivia Wilde directs the teen actresses with flair in a somewhat overhyped coming-of-age flick that falls short of recent gems like ""Eighth Grade"" and ""Lady Bird.""","A wonderful celebration of not just female friendship, but of a generation that's smart, cool and open to progression and inclusivity.",Almost certainly a teen classic in the making.,"It's a lot harder than it looks to land this stuff. Wilde has done the hard yards, picking up tips from directors like Martin Scorsese (Vinyl) and Spike Jonze (Her) along the way.",A tremendously entertaining coming-of-age comedy. [Full review in Spanish],"Booksmart succeeds in inclusivity and modernity, but its . . . characters lack context when it comes to teen culture or the funhouse mirror that refracts its many inspirations.","Hilariously smart, audaciously original and expertly performed this is a top contender for comedy of the year.",A poem to friendship and a celebration of the new generations. [Full review in Spanish],"It feels fresh and original, mostly because it does well the postmodern trick of mixing and matching old forms.","Olivia Wilde and company take something we've seen before, adjust the perspective just enough to make it fresh, and with sharp focus and fabulous leads, deliver a new high school classic.","Booksmart is a sharp, hilarious and, as it progresses, very touching coming-of-age film.","A moving, modern view of teenage life that's both very funny and draped in kindness and vulnerability.","With Booksmart, Olivia Wilde turns in a flawless debut that is a hilariously heartwarming coming of age story.","Powered by a quartet of female writers and endearing lead performances, Booksmart truly stands out from its peers by unabashedly celebrating female friendship and intelligence.","It stars a pair of credible, three-dimensional characters, and combines hilarious moments with plausible dramatic elements.

The characters they play, and the other characters they interact with in the film are what make this an exceptional film.","Booksmart is feminist, foul-mouthed and funny, turning the formulaic tropes of bawdy comedies inside out and giving us a couple of teen heroines who feel real and very 2019.","It felt decidedly new, from the pair of friends at the centre of the story to the celebration of female intelligence, ambition and loyalty.","Franklin's voice fills the room. Nearly a half-century later, many audience members will feel just as carried away.","As for the film's own balance between conscientious goals and living for kicks, it's neatly done.

A Night at the Opera (1935),"Uproarious high spots -- the best, perhaps, of their kind -- render A Night at the Opera, starring Groucho, Harpo and Chico, a champion comedy in the year's output. In some ways, it is the best comedy in which the three brothers have ever appeared.","Their eccentric adventures from Milan to New York contain such notable scenes as that in Groucho's cabin; the impersonation of the foreign aviators; the disruption of the opera orchestra; and the final, breathless sequences.","Considering that the dialogue of A Night at the Opera was written by two such theatrical craftsmen as George Kaufman and Morris Rysklnd, it reaches a surprising nadir of inanity.","Groucho, Chico and Harpo continue to be collectively and individually three of the really first-rate comedians of today. Their only peers are Mr. Charles Chaplin and Mr. W. C. Fields.","The scenes at the opera house during a performance offer not only good music but extremely laugh-provoking comedy, caused by the antics of the Marx Brothers.",A Night at the Opera is the most beautifully timed madness of 1935.,"Clowning such as these players indulge in must be clever if it is not to become boring, and the fact that their idiosyncrasies, no matter how extravagant, never pall, is the best indication of the success they achieve.",To attempt to criticize the Marxes is heresy and schism and we'll have none of it.,"This is pantomime at its best, and the greatest clown of the three is Harpo.","Groucho follows his own formula of throwing out gags, good and bad. as fast as he can talk, letting the good ones float the bad ones, trusting that the average will favor him.","A Night At the Opera is quite the funniest, the most ambitious and the most entertaining of any of the Marx cinema offerings.","Whether one likes the Marx Brothers or not, one has to admit that they could certainly entice a prima donna into accompanying them to the mad-house.","It is only at intervals that the Marx Brothers are allowed in to turn the normal world upside down in their own imitable way. The intervals are, however, in the best Marxian manner.",Every minute of the picture offers something new to laugh at. It's the best and most insane of their releases since they started their mad flight across the cinema heavens.,"The film has a definite and important musical angle, and it is to the credit of producer and director that the two angles of the production have been so successfully interwoven.",You'll howl at this one.,"Rich, racy humour, with operatic interludes, is presented by the three Marx Brothers in A Night At The Opera.","Either A Night at the Opera is the Marx Brothers' funniest picture, or it has been so long since they have appeared on the screen.","Sandwiched between the mad pranks of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo are a number of operatic selections and non-classical songs, which are exceptionally well rendered by Kitty Carlisle -- who looks like a future star -- and Allan Jones.","As usual when the Marx Brothers are on hand, plot gives place to panic and It's only a question of picking one's pet scenes and taking care not to laugh oneself to death right there in the theatre.",There is a tremendous amount of talent hidden beneath the vitality and boisterousness of the Marx boys.,"They call it A Night at the Opera, and what a night! But equally entertaining is what precedes that memorable night.","It has more movie sense - if you can call any Marxian manifestation sense - than any of its predecessors; it is better cut, better presented, has better gags, and the emphasis is more evenly distributed among the brothers.","Their latest picture is, in my estimation, the funniest they've ever made... [director Sam Wood] keeps the story moving at a fast pace and lets the gags fall where they are sure to do the most good.","The Kaufman-Ryskind satire makes way for sheer, unadulterated Marxian farce, which is just as it should be, for only when Groucho, Chico and Harpo are ignoring decorum are they effective.",Luckily the the film is sufficiently rich in comic invention to compensate for the banality of its material. My only objection is that it throws away an open chance for satire.,"For those who want comedy - new, fresh and vivid - it's Groucho, Chico and Harpo Marx, individually and collectively, as they never have been before.",The Marx brothers' overwhelming humor prevailed. [Full review in Spanish],George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind have supplied the comedians with excellent material in their screenplay based on James Kevin McGuinness' original story.

Sans Duck Soup, we'll watch this any day.",Never was a director more aptly named than Sam Wood: his movies are redwood forests of unrelieved monotony.,"[The Marx Brothers] still let the air out of stuffed shirts and barbecue a few sacred cows, but something got lost in all that MGMness when the screen's ultimate anti-authoritarian team starting working the Andy Hardy side of the street.",The loudest and funniest screen comedy of the Winter season.,...generally an entertaining piece of work...,The Brothers get to perform some of their most irresistible routines.,"Classic, classy Marxist mayhem","Fresh off the failure of ""Duck Soup,"" this was the Marx Brothers' comeback movie.

Roma (2018),"The subjects are incredibly un-cinematic, as his camera documents - in a somewhat documentarian style - the lives and lifestyles of painfully average people.","Aesthetically, the film is gorgeous. Cuaron has an attention for detail that other filmmakers should study.",Transcendent.,Perhaps the true mastery of the film is that it never actually feels like a masterpiece.,"Cuarón's work as a writer, director and cinematographer are beyond perfection. His use of chaos to create the ordinary are the work of a genius. [Full review in Spanish]","A slow-burn film that recalls the Italian Neorealist movement. The goal is a slice-of-life character study rather than plot twists, but if you flip your mental switch, it's a subtly enveloping film that elicits nostalgia.","The result is the most novelistic and experiential offering yet for [Cuarón], but make no mistake: Roma is not a film of gimmicks.","Cuarón has a crafted something that is purely, assuredly human.","It doesn't happen often, but sometimes as a film critic you exit a film so extraordinary and emotionally stirring that words nearly fail you. Writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor Alfonso Cuarón's deeply personal work Roma is just such an experience.","Each moment, each dialogue build toward something very special, and then, the movie takes your head, looks you in the eyes and inspects your soul. [Full review in Spanish]","Gorgeous and formally flawless, the director's precision and meticulous craft is unmatched, and his deep, personal connection to the story readily shines through. Roma is all of these things, but it also left me absolutely cold.","It's a beautiful, emotional, human film, without music, which recreates an era with great aesthetic meticulousness and dissects the inequalities between social classes in a particular period of Mexican sociopolitical history. [Full review in Spanish]","In Cuarón's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before.","The movie's distance here works against it, emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality, Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim.","Roma is intimate, epic and female-focused, not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City.","Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe.

Hers is a brilliant, unmannered performance.",Alfonso Cuarón's most masterful film contains multitudes.,"By paying homage to his childhood, [Cuarón] has created a simple yet jaw-droppingly beautiful film that can only be seen as one thing: a visual masterpiece.","The surround system is equally sublime, simulating action not seen on the screen, giving the film a transportive, immersive feel.",This is less a plot-driven film than a cinematic experience of being transported back in space and time. To a place in memory where anything can still be a marvel and the ordinary is sacred.,"""Roma"" is the year's most gorgeous film too, capturing people and places with stunning clarity and intimacy.","It struck me as remarkable that a film of this prestige and calibre contained such an honest, direct message - you're much stronger than you think you are, even if nobody cares to notice it.",This film is a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking.,"[Roma] pays attention to the overlooked, the lowly, the humble -- the things a utilitarian, power-obsessed world disregards or merely uses.","If the streaming giant's theatrical rollout finds its way to your vicinity, you owe yourself the unique experience of sitting down in a seat in order to walk through someone else's memory. It's like nothing you've ever heard or seen.","'Roma' is Cuarón's most personal work: it is raw and hopeless, but, above all, very beautiful. [Full Review in Spanish]","In this amazing representation of atmospheres, the work the Production Design team delivers is effective and very innovative.

[Full Review in Spanish],The clarity of the film's images is like a slap to the face confronting us with a past that is at times too much to bear.,I couldn't help but marvel and wonder if this was what it must have felt like to be among the audience to see Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves or Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura for the first time.,"Rooted in Cuarón's memories, Roma is a love letter to the woman who raised him and the city he called home.","Much of the narrative plays like a cinematic diary of Cleo's day-to-day life; the camera, a compassionate observer thoughtfully taking note of the moments of transcendence within the ordinariness of a life of devoted service.","The fact is, the film really just needs to be seen to fully appreciate Cuaron's artistry in making the everyday seem profound.","If you can see it on the big screen, you'll be rewarded. Partly because it looks so great, and partly because it's a sedate film that needs a real investment by the viewer.","The astounding size of the purse to promote ""Roma"" paid off with a nomination and other awards, but it buys me little appreciation except for the downright beauty of the black and white imagery.","Roma is an impressive cinematic achievement: a revolutionary movie for contemporary mexican cinema and an intimate reflection on Mexico City's history, sounds, divisions and feelings. [Full review in Spanish]","The black-and-white spectacle captures the memory of childhood, in unflinching clarity.","A beautiful glimpse into middle class malaise in 1970s Mexico, Cuarón shows an affinity for the simplicity of life then and the complexity that often creates waves.","Breathtaking cinematography captures the most anxious, harrowing, loving, even banal moments and bathes them in shimmering beatific light. But Roma also insists on being a narrative. And that requires more than just pretty pictures.","You will have to wait for things to get going but, when they do, this film becomes a tapestry of emotion executed in sublime style.","It's beautiful story, he shot it himself along side writing and directing, at this stage we can see it in a bunch of different places, its on Netflix & in theaters, but go see it in theaters!",An incidental thread that serves as an excuse for the director to capture on screen an amalgam of memories and a veritable whirlwind of sensations on the surface.

The Third Man (1949),"As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful.","The writing, the acting, the music, and the locations are so distinct and recognizable that they have become lodged in our consciousness.","Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero.","The astounding acting bit, it may turn out, is that contributed by Orson Welles. As the object of this chilling search, Welles for once is pulled back to the size of a gifted actor, a trick for which he and a lot of old Welles' admirers can thank Reed.",The music is as distinctive as the James Bond or Star Wars theme...,"This film is lively, always moving forward, constantly bubbling with mystery and suspicion and secrets, but the characters are always driving the film.",We're seduced out of caring for Greene's weary plot. Welles saves the film and destroys it.,"Krasker's camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city - so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself - except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground.","By the very nature of its settings and story, there are occasional reminiscences of Lang and Hitchcock, but there is nothing borrowed or imitated. Stylistically, The Third Man is Reed's most impressive film.","Welles was a still-ridiculously young 34 when he played Harry, but he was probably born sounding 56...","The bombed buildings, piles of rubble and their evocative shadows form a haunting backdrop to the outdoor scenes, particularly at night. ... Greene's talent for dialogue and suspense shine. [It] has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.","It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking.","Reed and screenwriter Graham Greene let the story unfold slowly and deliberately, like the cigarette smoke that floats around the characters, and keep us guessing at every step.","Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life.","What really makes the film sing, though, isn't the jaunty and iconic zither score by Anton Karas. It's the film's groundbreaking visual aesthetic, which combines noir tropes with expressionism to create a visual wonderland of living shadows.","This is a film which does away with such cretinous inanity as offering up goodies and baddies, instead presenting its cast of characters as doing things which they believe to be good, but are not seen as such through the eyes of observers.","""The Third Man"" is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme ...",Few films more effectively capture the crumbling infrastructure and opportunistic lawlessness of postwar Europe. And none better translate the snaking treachery of Graham Greene's stories and his worlds of cynical expats and casual betrayal.,"Set in postwar occupied Vienna, the plot is a corker, littered with memorable moments and played to perfection by an unforgettable cast that's led with distinction by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.",Best read not as an homage to Hitchcock - or to special super secret guest star Orson Welles - than as a study of what Carol Reed biographer Robert F. Moss describes as 'the ineffectuality of goodness.',"A lot funnier than you remember it, Carol Reed's immortal 1949 film noir seems to exist in the space between two worlds: an earlier time when thrillers were mostly serious affairs, and a future one, when such supremely witty entertainments felt passé.",The Third Man is a movie of sobering pleasures.,"The movie's verve comes from the abstract use of a jangling zither and from squirting Orson Welles into the plot piece-meal with a tricky, facetious eyedropper.","The truth is often what one least expects it to be, and the ability to cope with the seemingly unbelievable is a dividing line between Reed's characters.",As powerful and original now as it was in 1949.,One of British cinema's most enduring and atmospheric thrillers. A genuine and endlessly rewatchable classic.,Directors like Reed and Wilder created an environment of spatial and moral confusion in which their pulpy narratives could take on the ethical weight of a Biblical proverb.,"Greene's story and screenplay, which he accurately described as ""a comic thriller,"" is a gift that keeps on giving, with patter that's never less than brilliant. [Criterion Blu-ray]","If The Third Man is a tragedy, it isn't just the tragedy of a hobbled city, scribbled with ruins and parsed into zones of occupation that can't communicate and don't cooperate.",It transformed the way I looked at the world.,"As you watch the film, you feel as though the screen is tilted higher, glowering over you as you wince in its devastating presence, which is probably how Martins felt scurrying through the Vienna darkness.","It's a suspense-thriller-romance steeped in Hollywood's best influences and 'gimmicks,' yet it's crafted with enough looming European 'art-house' style to topple Fritz Lang into an existential funk.",This is a unique classic.,An iconic film noir that's still fresh despite being familiar.,"An undisputed masterpiece, this movie captures the mood of Vienna in post-WWII like no other, and is also a testimony to film as a collaborative art, benefiting from Greene's writing, Reed's direction, and stellar cast with Orson Welles at his scariest","Welles gives Harry a mask of irony that turns all moral judgment back on itself. He turns a mass murderer into a wry rogue, and makes his villainy all the more horrifying because we rather like him.","Do herói fragilizado e patético ao fascinante vilão, passando pela fotografia inesquecível, a trilha surpreendente e uma Viena inigualável, o filme é simplesmente perfeito.","The Third Man isn't an eager crowd-pleaser, but it's great. The film is distinctly British, with a wonderfully bizarre zither score by Anton Karas.",Is it perfect? Maybe the answer has more to do with semantics than film craft; it's at least indistinguishable from flawlessness.,"Seen today, The Third Man ... can be appreciated as a prophetic statement on the eventual moral bankruptcy of the one-world euphoria that clouded men's minds immediately after the second 'war to end all wars.'",A monumental arty thriller of British noir.,"This handsomely shot black-and-white thriller hasn't aged one bit. Terrific writing, direction and acting never go out of style.",About as close to a perfect film as you're likely to get.,,Everything you ever wanted to know about the dark side of human nature can be found in Orson Welles' smirking face,,"A true classic, wonderful selection for college film series audiences.",Top credit must go to Mr. Reed for molding all possible elements into a thriller of superconsequence.,,"It's hard to choose just one scene to sum up this poetic thriller, but the legendary scene on the ferris wheel may best represent its perfect blend of great writing, acting, and directing."

That was my favorite part.,This movie was emotional.,"A sweeping, lovingly detailed epic of sorts that benefits from its unique setting and Latin-American soundtrack.","Coco may be run-of-the-mill Pixar, but any movie that sticks it to certain notorious anti-Mexican deserves my respect.","The music is enchanting, the visuals are stunning, and the overall family theme will have your family appreciating traditions, roots and a desire to create even more memories.","Yes, the set design is gorgeous in the land of the dead, and the family-centered theme is a winner... however, Coco's story-line didn't wow me.","Tender, a tad macabre, fun-packed, and just plain beautiful.

See it with your fam, but maybe show up a half hour after the scheduled start time.","Coco  is a wonder, a dazzling and deeply moving candy-colored fantasia fueled by the power of music.","Coco is another Pixar masterstroke that stalls a bit in the middle, but comes back for one hell of a third act.",The best movie of 2017. An emotionally moving classic!,"Aside from being entertaining and joyful, it's a charming and emotive representation of Mexican culture.",[Coco] has a huge emotional punch to it.,"This is a powerful, intense movie, and while it may be a little too dark for very young viewers, Coco manages to deliver lessons about identity and life in an entertaining way, and ultimately makes for very satisfying (and emotional) viewing.","Moving, amusing and downright grooving, Coco stands out in the Pixar pantheon as their first truly diverse feature.",A very special film.,Great animated film with a taboo subject that's very well executed. Tears will eventually come.

Thor: Ragnarok (2017),"All the drama, romance, and mythological storytelling has been dropped for one major component: humor.",Marvel's comedic approach to Thor delivers on all accounts.,Thank goodness for the idiosyncratic visions of director Taika Waititi who does a complete 180 on the first two films by making Thor: Ragnarok into a superhero comedy.,"Witty, action-heavy, and beautiful to look at, Thor: Ragnarok is another clear winner for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",The first time that Hemsworth has really lived into the fullness of Thor's potential.,Finally a live adaptation of Thor that's actually worth your time!,"irected by New Zealand's Taika Waititi, it's the daftest movie from the comic book studio to date, shot through with the anarchically quirky humour in Waititi's films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Boy.",It's when the second half of Ragnarok falls into the motions that it begins to lose its shine.,"Instead of playing Thor as a Shakespearean persona, Waititi allows Hemsworth to use his natural wit and comedic timing to really bring the character to life.",Thor: Ragnarok is a prime example of how a complete tonal shift can rejuvenate a film series.,"Thor is a character that keeps us guessing, and honestly, I can't wait to see what he does next.","Waititi puts you right in the middle of a crazy, fantasy world to take an acid trip of pure fun, action, while accompanied by kick-ass characters.

Selma (2014),"Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings.",Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.,"Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll.","The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People.","Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time.","In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come.","...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question.",It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.,"...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965.","As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational.","Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it.","Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today.",There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.,A very satisfying picture.,"In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever.","Selma's cultural significance is critical and will inevitably permeate all conversations about the film. As a reviewer, I must stress that its cinematic value speaks for itself, even when you swipe away the context of today's struggles.","Selma serves as a pointed and poignant riposte to our current historical moment. It's an important film about an important story. It deserves to be seen, shared, discussed, and, like the events it depicts, never forgotten.",What makes Selma a truly fine film is the imagery we see.,"Director Ava DuVernay has crafted an impressive film that doesn't just chronicle the events in Selma, but serves as an impressive portrait of King both as a leader in the civil rights movement and a flawed family man.","From the intriguing backroom politics to the sacrifices made during the era, director Ava DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb turns a well-documented history lesson into essential cinema.","Selma rejects... the false ingenuity of the oscarizable biopic, to bet on a polyphonic story, where Dr. King becomes a cohesive element of a series of social agents essential for a change. [Full review in Spanish]","Selma is decidedly matter-of-fact and yet it bursts with emotion. When confronted with scenes of shocking brutality, DuVernay knows exactly when to turn the camera away.",It seems the reason we haven't yet had a major King biopic is because cinema was waiting for a director to make a film as worthy as the man himself - Ava DuVernay has stepped up to the daunting task and she has succeeded effortlessly.,"Nevertheless, the performances are uniformly excellent with Oyelowo conveying both the iconic magnetism and human-sized modesty of King's personality.",One of Selma's clearest intentions is the promotion of interracial unity that is necessary when abuses have been imposed on any social or ethnic group. [Full review in Spanish],"With a couple of feature films on her resume, Selma is the film that will probably take off director Ava DuVernay's career.

[Full review in Spanish]","Excellent acting, very good directing, a good tight script -- a little bit of pacing issues and... other characters are nowhere near as investing as Martin Luther King is.",Selma convinces that this is a tale of transcendence instead of hardship; triumph rather than defeat. And it's a story whose resonance is ever so desperately needed in the pervasive now.,"DuVernay's film is too effective on its own dramatic terms for it to be reduced simply to an allegory for Where We Are Today, yet it's also tremendously encouraging for anyone who wonders if there's any hope for change.","While there has been some streamlining of the facts for the sake of storytelling efficiency, an outraged and righteous heart beats strongly throughout.","There have been surprisingly few cinematic renderings of Martin Luther King Jr's legacy, but despite the lack of competition, British actor David Oyelowo's embodiment of the great man is simply superb.","If you don't mind the technical confusion it's a gripping story, and a great credit to DuVernay and co-writer Paul Webb who were unable to use King's original speeches for copyright reasons.","Ava DuVernay's Selma is a beautifully observed drama of public and private lives, of personal narratives and historic moments.","DuVernay, with just her third feature film, knows how to marshal the moments that will become history, making her own iconic images.",An important and necessary film. [Full Review in Spanish],The structure with which the film is designed turns out to be as beneficial and intriguing as it is unsatisfactory and imprecise. [Full Review in Spanish],Listen to Common's track over the final credits. This movie is continuing a conversation that America cannot ignore.,"Selma is an always-gripping, often-bruising film, with fantastic performances and a solidly written script that contextualizes King's work in an effectively impactful way.","Don't let this put you off Selma: it's a good, although not great movie, that steers a coherent path through a weighty historical moment.","Director DuVernay has crafted a cinematic work for the ages, with a magnificent performance from Oyelowo.","David Oyelowo is magnetic in his quiet, still performance and for those unfamiliar with these events, DuVernay's film is quite an education - it's also one historical drama with a very contemporary and real message.","Looks better than the average historical drama; some top-notch performances, especially from Oyelowo; occasional moments of greatness","With more nuance, this could have been a great film. As it is, it's merely a good one, but glittering with great performances."

But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.,"I don't see how any gifted actor could have done less than Brando does here. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker.","... its amber antique look, its misty-eyed, soft-hearted vision of honorable men battling for their shot at the American main chance as much a part of our collective iconography as ... Citizen Kane or ... The Great Gatsby.","The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood.","This elegiac organised-crime saga from the young Francis Ford Coppola is one of the all-time high watermarks of American cinema, rich with subtle acting and blessed with stunning cinematography from Gordon Willis.","That lasting popularity isn't a fluke; the ""Godfather"" films stand the test of time because these aren't just movies, they're cultural touchstones.","To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino.",Brando's triumph and fascination is less that of an actor of parts than of a star galaxy of myths.,It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great.

Arrival (2016),"If there was such a precedent, this film might be considered an alien encounter procedural.","Arrival expertly uses conventions of the genre to explore free-will, experiences and memory, in a film that is as personal as it is relatable.","A film as comfortable with universe-twisting ideologies as it is with the intimate, perhaps universal, experiences of communication, grief, discovery and trust.",Arrival is a feeble science fiction parable from Denis Villeneuve.,Arrival showcases the best performance you'll see by Amy Adams.,It's not easy to encounter a film that makes you meditate on its content days after watching it.

It will challenge you with its complex plot and its ideas about life, death, communication and the nature of time.

The narrative is non-linear and intriguing but smooth.","In part a response to Stanley Kubrick's heady masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey and equally a dissection of current world politics, Arrival is Villeneuve's most emotionally charged and visually curious film to date.",I can't help but feel like the film is eventually a bit too clever for its own good,Arrival is genius technical filmmaking combined with a profound message -- that we are happy because we choose to live life despite its inevitability and predictability

And as the opening film in this new chapter of the MCU, it sets the stage for the bigger and better to come.","Some of the comedy doesn't land well, or there is too much of it in a row, but in general I feel the film is a good bit of harmless fun, full of action and great set pieces.","Fun, lively, high school spirit as Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man to date. No Marvel fatigue with this one.","Spider-Man works better when he's alone, just a scared high school kid trying to negotiate a crazy world where Jake Gyllenhaal wears a fishbowl on his head.","Brimming with heart... up there in the upper echelon of MCU movies, and in Mysterio fans are given a fascinating character who ultimately has a key, key role in changing the landscape of this shared Marvel realm.","After Endgame, Spider-Man: Far from Home didn't need to be amazing - it needed to reassure audiences that there is still life in the MCU. Thanks to Holland's performance, it looks like Spider-Man is here to stay....at least for a while.","[T]his one is a genuine winner and never wears out its welcome, even if we've all seen far too many superhero movies this past decade.",The MCU and director Jon Watts did an excellent job reminding the audience of Peter's humanity and boyhood without sacrificing the thrills and action scenes.,"Spider-Man: Far from Home builds upon what's come before and improves those elements that needed some help. The finished product is something that is fun, funny and heartfelt.","It's an affable film. It's a pivot film, is what it is... It's lighter and has a good deal more in common with Guardians of the Galaxy.","A fresher, reinvigorated, [and] much more energetic Spider-Man than I've seen in a long time.","The recent ending of the Infinity saga and everything that went with is so large that Far From Home is more of a statement on that than anything else, leaving its main character to tag a long after his class and after his story.","This Spider-man adventure is fun enough, but it's more preoccupied with serving as an Endgame epilogue than a sequel to the character's own franchise.","An entertaining film, but one overburdened by a formulaic structure.","The perfect Spider-Man movie, Far From Home is an adventure for the web-slinger like no other and will leave fans talking for a long time to come. Prepare for your jaw to be left on the floor!",A worthy addition to the Spidey family.,"One of the most delightful things about Spider-Man is that he's a happy-go-lucky kid who's psyched to have powers and help people, and Holland portrays that vibe perfectly.","Holland continues to bring a wide-eyed, boyish charm to the role, and his chemistry with his co-stars remains intact.",There's much fun to be had here and Tom Holland continues to make the perfect Spidey. So why does it feel so insubstantial?,"Watts follows the Marvel playbook perfectly, crafting a delightfully entertaining movie that's bright, funny, exciting, and speedy, and also one that doesn't evaporate immediately.","I found the film lots of fun to watch, but by the end, the special effects -- amazing as they are -- took over and had a numbing effect.","Holland is spectacular, proving hilarious and warm throughout his European adventure -- he gets a pretty rad set of costumes too.",There is much to enjoy and admire in Far From Home but one can't help but feel these MCU movies are becoming increasingly samey.,"...a wheel-spinning opening hour that's rife with pointless, incoherent action sequences...","Ehe new Spider-Man feels like a throwback to an older, more holistically built era of studio movies -- if only for caring about the people in it and in front of it much more than we're lately used to.","The epilogue to Avengers: Endgame first, and  Iron Man 4 second, and a Spider-Man vehicle only when it cannot find a reason to be one of the other things.",Spider-Man: Far From Home feels like super hero movie on autopilot.,The film takes what it needs from the MCU and then uses the rest as punchlines. It works! This was a great summer comedy.,"Most impressive here is the use of a European school excursion to emphasize Peter Parker's enduring appeal, that he is a mere teenager with raging hormones who is still learning about what it means to be a superhero.","Some plots seem too long, tedious and the turning point only happens after one hour of story.

[Full Review in Spanish],Spielberg's visual inventiveness in much of E.T. is of sufficiently high quality to make one regret those passages where he falls below his best.,Some of the performances are part of the reason why it works so well... I can't think of a child actor that that pulls off such emotional depth.,"This is a real movie, with all those elements that have proved sure-fire through history; Laughter, tears, involvement, thrills, wonderment. Steven Spielberg also adds a message: Human beings and spacelings should learn to co-exist.",Director Steven Spielberg knew we'd all fall in love with E.T. for one very good reason: he embodies what we hope all aliens will be like when they finally visit our planet.,"No matter how much time passes, E.T. will always be right here.",Spielberg has crafted with warmth and humor a simple fantasy that works so superbly on so many levels that it will surely attract masses of moviegoers from all demographics.,"Steven Spielberg's E. T., The Extra-Terrestrial is the best cinematic fairy tale since The Wizard of Oz.",E.T. ...comes to a beleaguered industry like a gift from the gods. Not only does it get bums on seats but it encourages the kind of shared enjoyment that suggests the cinema still has something unique to offer.,The marvel of this extraordinary movie is that it captures for even the most jaded grownup that pleasurable state of innocence and awe that only children are fortunate enough to experience.,"Spielberg works well with children, but never before has he directed them with such reticence or such appreciation of their humor, intelligence and decency.",It lifts you into its make-believe in the wonderfully enriching way that only movies can do. I wouldn't be surprised if 'E.T.' eventually turned into the kind of durable classic that can be revived indefinitely for future generations.,"It's connection, its life, and it's about feelings of love that tends to transcend species and stars.","With a touching relationship at the core of its compelling narrative, along with a brilliant score and nostalgic special effects, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial remains one of director Steven Spielberg's most beloved films.","It's a fantastical adventure with a grounding in the modern (circa 1982) world of suburbia, divorce, and adolescent anxiety, and E.T. is the ultimate imaginary playmate come to life.",What makes the movie a masterpiece is the intensely visceral way in which Spielberg conveys these children feeling adult emotions for the first time.,"Without a doubt, I can say this is a masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]","Spielberg would seem to be groping towards a virtual theology of space, space as Heaven, offering solace to a world which has foolishly renounced its traditional God but still aches to extend its own spiritual frontiers.","E.T. is essentially a spiritual autobiography, a portrait of the filmmaker as a typical suburban kid set apart by an uncommonly fervent, mystical imagination. It comes out disarmingly funny, spontaneous, bighearted.","Captivating, endearingly optimistic and magical at times, Steven Spielberg's fantasy about a stranded alien from outer space protected by three kids until it can arrange for passage home is certain to capture the imagination of the world's youth.","What's perhaps most amazing about E.T., what distinguishes it from many of the other fantasy films of its era, is its ability to put an audience under a spell of childlike wonderment without infantilizing it.","Spielberg's direction and Melissa Mathison's script never lose sight of the realistic, low center of gravity world of childhood, in which such marvelous adventures happen every day.",It holds up beautifully.,"There are many big moments in E.T., but also plenty of magical small ones that make it work after all these years.",My heart still soars as Elliott goes airborne and pedals across the face of an impossibly full harvest moon on his bike.,The movie is emotionally tumultuous and evenhanded and serene.,"It is a hugely enjoyable romp, but compellingly spiked throughout with little stabs of anxiety.",Time has done little to diminish the power of E.T.'s signature moments.,The film is full of funny scenes and magical moments.,"Though marred by Spielberg's usual carelessness with narrative points, the film alternates sweetness and sarcasm with enough rhetorical sophistication to be fairly irresistible.","E.T. remains Spielberg's finest demonstration of his ability to merge the feelings of suburban dissatisfaction - alienation, if you will - that permeates a lot of his work, with a unique sense of childhood wonder and imagination",It is the kind of film that young people are going to want to see again immediately after they've seen it.,"This is a special, delightful adventure, in which Spielberg manages not only to entertain young children but also reach out to the child in all of us.",You're still gonna need those tissues.,"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial still evokes laughter, tears and that heart-lifting surge of joy only a great movie can bring.","Unchecked goodness has its price, after all, and childhood wonder wouldn't be nearly as sweet if it didn't fade.

It trapped that feeling, and its sense of possibility, in amber -- then, now, and for any time.","among all that corniness, there's a great little movie",...a celebration of kid culture from a time when fun meant riding your bike and playing D&D with your friends.,"It makes us believe in magic again even as grizzled, cynical adults.","One of Spielberg's two or three masterpieces, an extremely satisfying sci-fi fable.",Steven Spielberg at his most pure.,"An appealing film this new one is, with some charm, some glee in the childrens' triumphs, some share in their friendship with E.T.",Spielberg triumphantly succeeds in bringing the magical to the everyday.,"More than the work of any other filmmaker, Spielberg's output seems uniquely designed to induce in me this queasy false-memory syndrome.","On inherent merit, the movie would not warrant such a highly publicized re-release, but this is one of those films that transcends what's on the screen.",A contemporary classic.,"It helped alter the course of sci-fi movies by suggesting that intergalactic aliens might not be monsters but friendly, even loving, creatures.

It is exciting, funny, cute, tense, melancholy, smart, goofy, unexpected, and occasionally profound.","The structure, at times, is similar to 30-minute episodes of a miniseries event that we're binge watching.

All About Eve (1950),The kind of dialogue actors kill for.,"Acridly cynical (realizing Addison's self-proclaimed contempt for humanity, coupled with insatiable ambition) and somewhat unpleasant, yet highly influential.","Betty Davis gives the finest performance of her career.

Its appeal and its success depend almost entirely on gesture and conversation.",All About Eve is in essence a play fabricated into celluloid with absolutely no feeling for pictorial style or form.,"a smart, insightful, and darkly humorous drama about the intersections of art and show business and that insatiable appetite we call ambition","Writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's enduring masterpiece -- and, incidentally, my all-time favorite film.","n a movie in which everyone is preoccupied with learning all about her character, she remains alluringly, dangerously unknowable.","...a wise, witty, lusty and adult comedydrama which has to do with intrigue and doubledealing in the world of the Broadway theatre.","All About Eve ranks among the smartest comedy-dramas in many, many years.","It is similar to a good many films that have gone before it, but Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who wrote and directed the picture, has been so ingenious in his treatment of the subject that he has come up with a thoroughly entertaining movie.","Bette Davis is most certainly at the top of her game playing the crowd favourite Margo Channing,...",One of the greatest films of post-WWII Hollywood.,"All About Eve is not only a brilliant and clever portrait of an actress, it is a downright funny film, from its opening scene to the final fadeout.","Joseph L. Mankiewicz' All About Eve is a rich, impeccably written, gunshot sharp black comedy about an aging actress, the go-getter who seeks to supplant her, and the heaping pile of carefully fostered artisanal bitchiness that they construct.","Joseph L Mankiewicz's film dissects the narcissism and hypocrisy of the spotlight as sharply as [Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd], but pays equal attention to the challenges of enacting womanhood.","As if Bette Davis wasn't enough, the supporting cast is also fantastically emotive.","Joseph Mankiewicz was Hollywood's midcentury master of comic drama, and All About Eve, from 1950, was one of his signal achievements.","A classic movie, whose qualities remind us that there once was a Hollywood where such sophisticated treats could be made.",All About Eve is deliciously fun to watch with characters playing versions of themselves (most noticeably Bette Davis) and being quite introspective for its day.,Bette Davis is fabulous in this role.,"Screenwriting students, you have your Bible.

Shadow of a Doubt (1943),"For a story helmed by Hitchcock, one would expect the twists to be less straightforward.","There's something rotten in small-town, U.S.A., and Hitchcock chose Santa Rosa, California-one of the most picturesque cities in the nation-to set his tale of a modern-day wolf in sheep's clothing.","Still reeling after having seen this film, I do not want to spoil a moment of it for anyone else. I can only tell you that it is a brilliant Alfred Hitchcock melodrama, set mainly in a leafy sunny American town -- and leave the story at that.","To save studio materials, the film has been largely made in an actual Californian town and the gain is remarkable.","As we say. it is a curtailed Hitchcock, but still recognizably the one who tops the lot in artful melodrama.",A series of tense dramatic scenes superbly acted by Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright.,"Master of the suspense drama that he is, Hitchcock keeps his climax for the very end.

The plot's marred only by a slightly rushed and convenient ending.","If the motives of filmmakers are revealed in the frames of their more obscure pictures, then 'Shadow of a Doubt' is a resounding testament to the power of Alfred Hitchcock's vast creative engine.",Peels back the welcoming warmth and sincere innocence of small-town life to reveal the gullibility and the naïveté underneath; it's a fiction about the perpetuation of fictions.,"No one would ever accuse Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt of being plausible, but it is framed so distinctively in the Hitchcock style that it plays firmly and never breaks out of the story.","This Hitchcock masterpiece has the same general theme as his Suspicion -- the slow, terrible growth of fear of a loved one. But Shadow, from beginning to end, is a surpassingly better picture.",Alfred Hitchcock's first indisputable masterpiece.,Hitchcock deftly etches his small-town characters and homey surroundings.,The suspense builds effortlessly throughout.,The collaboration between Thornton Wilder and Hitchcock proves to be extremely fertile for it allows both American writer and British director to dissect small-town life way beyond the former's Our Town.,One of Hitchcock's finest films of the '40s.,"Like Lynch's fever-dream of transcendental perversity Blue Velvet, Shadow of a Doubt is about awakening, the simultaneous darkening and enlarging of the world.",Hitch's personal favorite and certainly one of his best.,"First rate Hitchcock thriller with deceptive Cotten, innocent but sharp Wright.",First-class psychological thriller.,Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt is one of his grimmest and most impressive movies.,,,Maybe the most German of Hitchcock's Hollywood films.,A tense thriller with one of Hitchcock's most creepy villains.,"One of Hitchcock's creepiest, and his personal favorite among his own films.",You've got to hand it to Alfred Hitchcock: when he sows the fearful seeds of mistrust in one of his motion pictures he can raise more goose pimples to the square inch of a customer's flesh than any other director of thrillers in Hollywood.,,,,"A great nail-biter, right up through the end.",One of Hitchcock's best 1940s films.,"Thanks in no small part to its precision acting, it's easily as great as other Hitchcock films to which 'masterpiece' status is more colloquially granted.","Among Hitchcock's films, Shadow of a Doubt is one of the most chilling.","The idea of ""bringing menace to a small town"" certainly appeals to the master","a brilliant piece of cynicism that exposes hypocrisy, moral rot, and a guilt that pervades both conventional criminals and everyday citizens",A minor classic from Hitch.,"Not one of Hitchcock's best, but is still one of his most intriguing.",Witty screenplay.,Shadow of a Doubt (1943) has often been seen as director/producer Alfred Hitchcock's best American film (and second film with Universal Studios),Done in fine style.,,,
The Kid (1921),"Every single one of Chaplin's features is a classic, but The Kid is his first, and one of his greatest in terms of personal progression and artistic ambition -- plus, one of the most emotionally heart-wrenching child performances ever put to celluloid.",Formerly it was the custom to say that Mr. Chaplin played down to the level of his audiences. Now it is to be hoped that he will lift his audiences up to this new level of his own.,The story is only of the average order... [but] the quality of the film lies in the joyous fooling of Chaplin and the Kid.,"As ""the Kid,"" Jackie Coogan's acting is remarkable, while the mother is portrayed by Edna Purviance. Charlie Chaplin is just his inimitable self.","I'll wager one unclipped Liberty Bond against a dozen small, soggy doughnuts that it will give more people more enjoyment than any other picture they have ever seen in a motion picture theater.","Chaplin is, of course, hilarious, but it's Coogan's cherubic charm that makes this so special.",[The Kid] has definitively cemented the actor's renown... in terms of his theatrical gifts. [Full review in Spanish],The Kid is a knockout.,"Chaplin shares the screen with an exceptional performance by Coogan, who is just as effective with emotional manipulation through expressions alone.","The Kid is a vastly entertaining picture, but there are some things in it which, we believe, were better left unsaid. Why is it that Chaplin, who is really an idealist, always has touches of vulgarity in his pictures?","The Kid (1921) is silent comic star Charlie Chaplin's classic of comedy and pathos - his first feature-length film (it was a more sophisticated six-reeler or ""6 Reels of Joy"" than his previous shorts).","Chaplin claimed that, ""Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot."" And The Kid is quite possibly the best example of this aphorism.","Chaplin proved himself equally adept at tickling funny bones and pulling heartstrings, and his chemistry with young Jackie Coogan remains one of cinema's great onscreen pairings",To my mind The Kid is by long odds the best motion picture comedy ever made. It has more than humor; it has tenderness and literary charm. Incidentally it is the first child picture I ever saw that did not give me an acute pain to the bowels.,"It was Chaplin's first full-length film, and the action is perhaps too episodic; he hadn't yet mastered the structural demands of the long form. But several of the episodes... are sublime.","The Kid, Charlie Chaplin's first feature-length production, is one of his most sentimental and most satisfying films, a simple but very effective blend of pathos and laughs, in which the Tramp finds an abandoned baby.","Clearly recalling his own troubled childhood in Victorian London, the film is remarkable for the chemistry between the Tramp and that window-smashing moppet Jackie Coogan.","Beyond its ability to wring the heart, The Kid of all Chaplin's pictures perhaps most manifests his extraordinary knowledge of life, which his sensitive perceptions and comic imagination use as the raw material for laughter.","The movie opens with the words ""a picture with a smile -- and perhaps, a tear,"" a mission statement that would serve Chaplin well over the ensuing decades.","a fantastic and brave work, forging new ground in its mixing of comedy and pathos and fully earning its opening title card, which promises ""a picture with a smile-and perhaps, a tear.""","[VIDEO ESSAY] ""The Kid"" is significant in cinema history because it is one of the first films to combine comedy and drama as a succinct filmic form. It is a nurturing comic movie that never gets old, regardless of how many times you watch it.",Timeless silent film blends humor with hardship.,"Critics at the time praised the film for its effortless combination of comedy and pathos, which is not as easy as it looks.","While it will move people to uproarious laughter and keep them in a state of uneasing delight, it also will touch their hearts and win sympathy, not only for the star, but for his leading woman, and little Jackie Coogan.","Never so sweet that the comedy suffers, and never so funny that the drama comes off as shallow.","Slapstick funny and sentimental, in equal doses.","As always, Chaplin's opulent Victorian sentimentality is made palatable both by the amazing grace of his pantomimic skills and the balancing presence of harsh reality.","Beautifully reflecting his growing maturity as a filmmaker as well as his ardor for the work, The Kid stands as a splendid introduction to Chaplin's movies.","There is less pure horse-play in The Kid than in the other Chaplins. The comedian depends chiefly upon his inimitable pantomime, and it scores every time.",,,,A beautiful film.,,"Projects such emotional veracity while getting such constant giggles that if there ever was a legitimate use of the clich ""you'll laugh, you'll cry,"" this is it.",,"Lots of very clever touches can be found in this brief film, and it stands up well today.",,Chaplin's first feature shows his undeniable touch and his brilliant mixture of slapstick and sentiment.,,"It's hard not to like The Kid, with its old-fashioned yet endearing combination of pathos and humor.",for Charlie the people who matter all have pure hearts,"Combinando com perfeio toques comoventes e engraados, o filme apresenta ao mundo um dos poucos atores que, ao lado de Chaplin, no empalideceram: o garotinho Jackie Coogan.",,,,,,,
